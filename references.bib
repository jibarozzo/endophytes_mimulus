  abstract = {Foliar fungal endophytes are known to alter plant physiology but the mechanisms by which they do so remain poorly understood. We focused on how plant gene expression was altered by six fungal strains that generated “water-saver” and “water-spender” drought physiologies in a C4 grass, Panicum hallii. Water-saver physiologies have lower plant water loss, improved wilt resistance, and higher survival compared with water-spender strategies. We expected that fungi within each functional group would have similar effects on P. hallii, and this was largely true for plant physiology but not for plant gene expression. When we focused only on genes that were differentially expressed relative to fungus-free controls, we found surprisingly little overlap in plant differentially expressed genes or gene regulatory pathways across the fungal treatments, including within and between the water-saver and water-spender strategies. Nevertheless, using lasso regression, we identified a small subset of genes that predicted 39 and 53\% of the variation in plant wilt resistance and water loss, respectively. These results suggest that fungal effects on plant transcription may identify how they extend the plant phenotype, and the comparison across multiple fungi allows us to differentiate broadly fungal-responsive plant genes versus those plant genes that respond only to single fungal taxa. The genes identified here could be targeted for future study to understand their function and, ultimately, represent candidates for precision breeding efforts to increase plant drought tolerance.

  abstract = {Abstract             Massively parallel sequencing has revolutionized many areas of biology, but sequencing large amounts of DNA in many individuals is cost-prohibitive and unnecessary for many studies. Genomic complexity reduction techniques such as sequence capture and restriction enzyme-based methods enable the analysis of many more individuals per unit cost. Despite their utility, current complexity reduction methods have limitations, especially when large numbers of individuals are analyzed. Here we develop a much improved restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing protocol and a new method called Rapture (RAD capture). The new RAD protocol improves versatility by separating RAD tag isolation and sequencing library preparation into two distinct steps. This protocol also recovers more unique (nonclonal) RAD fragments, which improves both standard RAD and Rapture analysis. Rapture then uses an in-solution capture of chosen RAD tags to target sequencing reads to desired loci. Rapture combines the benefits of both RAD and sequence capture, i.e., very inexpensive and rapid library preparation for many individuals as well as high specificity in the number and location of genomic loci analyzed. Our results demonstrate that Rapture is a rapid and flexible technology capable of analyzing a very large number of individuals with minimal sequencing and library preparation cost. The methods presented here should improve the efficiency of genetic analysis for many aspects of agricultural, environmental, and biomedical science.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Understanding the origins and maintenance of host specificity, or why horizontally‐acquired symbionts associate with some hosts but not others, remains elusive. In this study, we explored whether patterns of host specificity in foliar fungal endophytes, a guild of highly diverse fungi that occur within the photosynthetic tissues of all major plant lineages, were related to characteristics of the plant community. We comprehensively sampled all plant host species within a single community and tested the relationship between plant abundance or plant evolutionary relatedness and metrics of endophyte host specificity. We quantified host specificity with methods that considered the total endophyte community per plant host (i.e., multivariate methods) along with species‐based methods (i.e., univariate metrics) that considered host specificity from the perspective of each endophyte. Univariate host specificity metrics quantified plant alpha‐diversity (structural specificity), plant beta‐diversity (beta‐specificity), and plant phylogenetic diversity (phylogenetic specificity) per endophyte. We standardized the effect sizes of univariate host specificity metrics to randomized distributions to avoid spurious correlations between host specificity metrics and endophyte abundance. We found that more abundant plant species harbored endophytes that occupied fewer plant species (higher structural specificity) and were consistently found in the same plant species across the landscape (higher beta‐specificity). There was no relationship between plant phylogenetic distance and endophyte community dissimilarity. We still found that endophyte community composition significantly varied among plant species, families, and major groups, supporting a plant identity effect. In particular, endophytes in angiosperm lineages associated with narrower phylogenetic breadths of plants (higher phylogenetic specificity) compared to endophytes within conifer and fern lineages. Overall, an effect of plant species abundance may help explain why horizontally‐transmitted endophytes vary geographically within host species ranges.},

Fungal endophytes associated with leaves of woody angiosperms are especially diverse; yet, fundamental aspects of their interactions with hosts are unknown. In contrast to the relatively species-poor endophytes that are vertically transmitted and act as defensive mutualists of some temperate grasses, the diverse, horizontally transmitted endophytes of woody angio-sperms are thought to contribute little to host defense. Here, we document high diversity, spatial structure, and host affinity among foliar endophytes associated with a tropical tree (Theobroma cacao, Malvaceae) across lowland Panama. We then show that inoculation of endophyte-free leaves with endophytes isolated frequently from naturally infected, asymptomatic hosts signifi-cantly decreases both leaf necrosis and leaf mortality when T. cacao seedlings are challenged with a major pathogen (Phytophthora sp.). In contrast to reports of fungal inoculation inducing systemic defense, we found that protection was primarily localized to endophyte-infected tissues. Further, endophyte-mediated protec-tion was greater in mature leaves, which bear less intrinsic defense against fungal pathogens than do young leaves. In vitro studies suggest that host affinity is mediated by leaf chemistry, and that protection may be mediated by direct interactions of endophytes with foliar pathogens. Together, these data demonstrate the capacity of diverse, horizontally transmitted endophytes of woody angiosperms to play an important but previously unappreciated role in host defense.}

Microbial symbionts of plants profoundly influence host water relations (Lösch \& Gansert 2002), but are rarely considered in studies of tropical plant physiology. In particular, plant–fungus associations, which are ubiquitous in plant communities and especially common in tropical forests, play important and varied roles in plant water status. Fungal pathogens associated with roots, vascular tissue and foliage may interfere with water uptake and transport, increase rates of foliar transpiration, and induce xylem embolism and tissue death (Agrios 1997). In contrast, rhizosphere mutualists such as ecto- and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi may benefit hosts by increasing surface area for water uptake, enhancing stomatal regulation of water loss, and increasing root hydraulic conductivity (Auge 2001, Lösch \& Gansert 2002).},

Here, we outline how a random regression mixed model framework can be applied to plastic traits that show linear or nonlinear responses to temperature. Random regressions provide a powerful and efficient means of characterising plasticity and its variation. Although they have been used widely in other fields, they have only recently been implemented in plant evolutionary ecology. We outline their structure and provide an example tutorial of their implementation.},

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses — the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a new way of using forward selection of explanatory variables in regression or canonical redundancy analysis. The classical forward selection method presents two problems: a highly inflated Type I error and an overestimation of the amount of explained variance. Correcting these problems will greatly improve the performance of this very useful method in ecological modeling. To prevent the first problem, we propose a two‐step procedure. First, a global test using all explanatory variables is carried out. If, and only if, the global test is significant, one can proceed with forward selection. To prevent overestimation of the explained variance, the forward selection has to be carried out with two stopping criteria: (1) the usual alpha significance level and (2) the adjusted coefficient of multiple determination (                                                              ) calculated using all explanatory variables. When forward selection identifies a variable that brings one or the other criterion over the fixed threshold, that variable is rejected, and the procedure is stopped. This improved method is validated by simulations involving univariate and multivariate response data. An ecological example is presented using data from the Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah, USA.},

  abstract = {The identity of plant host genetic factors controlling the composition of the plant microbiota and the extent to which plant genes affect associated microbial populations is currently unknown. Here, we use a candidate gene approach to investigate host effects on the phyllosphere community composition and abundance. To reduce the environmental factors that might mask genetic factors, the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana was used in a gnotobiotic system and inoculated with a reduced complexity synthetic bacterial community composed of seven strains representing the most abundant phyla in the phyllosphere. From a panel of 55 plant mutants with alterations in the surface structure, cell wall, defense signaling, secondary metabolism, and pathogen recognition, a small number of single host mutations displayed an altered microbiota composition and/or abundance. Host alleles that resulted in the strongest perturbation of the microbiota relative to the wild-type were lacs2 and pec1. These mutants affect cuticle formation and led to changes in community composition and an increased bacterial abundance relative to the wild-type plants, suggesting that different bacteria can benefit from a modified cuticle to different extents. Moreover, we identified ein2, which is involved in ethylene signaling, as a host factor modulating the community's composition. Finally, we found that different Arabidopsis accessions exhibited different communities, indicating that plant host genetic factors shape the associated microbiota, thus harboring significant potential for the identification of novel plant factors affecting the microbiota of the communities.},

  abstract = {Fungal communities associated with plants often decrease in similarity as the distance between sampling sites increases (i.e., they demonstrate distance decay). In the southwestern USA, forests occur in highlands separated from one another by warmer, drier biomes with plant and fungal communities that differ from those at higher elevations. These disjunct forests are broadly similar in climate to one another, offering an opportunity to examine drivers of distance decay in plant-associated fungi across multiple ecologically similar yet geographically disparate landscapes. We examined ectomycorrhizal and foliar endophytic fungi associated with a dominant forest tree (Pinus ponderosa) in forests across ca. 550 km of geographic distance from northwestern to southeastern Arizona (USA). Both guilds of fungi showed distance decay, but drivers differed for each: ectomycorrhizal fungi are constrained primarily by dispersal limitation, whereas foliar endophytes are constrained by specific environmental conditions. Most ectomycorrhizal fungi were found in only a single forested area, as were many endophytic fungi. Such regional-scale perspectives are needed for baseline estimates of fungal diversity associated with forest trees at a landscape scale, with attention to the sensitivity of different guilds of fungal symbionts to decreasing areas of suitable habitat, increasing disturbance, and related impacts of climate change.},

  abstract = {Plant root−microbe interactions influence plant productivity, health, and resistance to stress. Although there is evidence that plant species and even genotypes can alter soil microbial community structure, environmental conditions can potentially outweigh plant genetic effects. Here, we used a reciprocal transplant experiment to understand the contributions of the environment and the host plant to rhizosphere microbiome composition in locally adapted ecotypes of Mimulus guttatus (syn. Erythranthe guttata). Two genotypes of a coastal ecotype and two genotypes of an inland ecotype were planted at coastal and inland sites. After 3 months, we collected rhizosphere and bulk soil and assessed microbial communities by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. We found that local environment (coastal versus inland site) strongly influenced rhizosphere communities, at least in part due to distinct local microbial species pools. Host identity played a smaller role: at each site, the ecotypes exhibited remarkably similar composition of microbial communities at the class level, indicating that divergent M. guttatus ecotypes recruit phylogenetically similar rhizosphere communities, even in environments to which they are maladapted. Nevertheless, the two ecotypes significantly differed in community composition at both sites due, in part, to an exclusive set of taxa associated with each ecotype. They also differed in alpha diversity at the inland site. Although this indicates that locally adapted M. guttatus ecotypes are genetically diverged in factors shaping rhizosphere communities, our findings highlight the context-specific interactions between host identity and local environment that shape those communities.

  abstract = {Although complex interactions between hosts and microbial associates are increasingly well documented, we still know little about how and why hosts shape microbial communities in nature. In addition, host genetic effects on microbial communities vary widely depending on the environment, obscuring conclusions about which microbes are impacted and which plant functions are important. We characterized the leaf microbiota of 200               Arabidopsis thaliana               genotypes in eight field experiments and detected consistent host effects on specific, broadly distributed microbial species (operational taxonomic unit [OTUs]). Host genetic effects disproportionately influenced central ecological hubs, with heritability of particular OTUs declining with their distance from the nearest hub within the microbial network. These host effects could reflect either OTUs preferentially associating with specific genotypes or differential microbial success within them. Host genetics associated with microbial hubs explained over 10\% of the variation in lifetime seed production among host genotypes across sites and years. We successfully cultured one of these microbial hubs and demonstrated its growth-promoting effects on plants in sterile conditions. Finally, genome-wide association mapping identified many putatively causal genes with small effects on the relative abundance of microbial hubs across sites and years, and these genes were enriched for those involved in the synthesis of specialized metabolites, auxins, and the immune system. Using untargeted metabolomics, we corroborate the consistent association between variation in specialized metabolites and microbial hubs across field sites. Together, our results reveal that host genetic variation impacts the microbial communities in consistent ways across environments and that these effects contribute to fitness variation among host genotypes.},

The combination of extreme physical and chemical factors contributes to the definition of extreme habitats although the definition of extreme environments changes depending on one's point of view: anthropocentric, microbial‐centric or zymo‐centric. Microorganisms that live under conditions that cause hard survival are called extremophiles. In particular organisms that require extreme conditions are called true extremophiles while organisms that tolerate them to some extent are termed extremotolerant. Deviation of temperature, pH, osmotic stress, pressure and radiation from the common range delineates extreme environments. Yeasts are versatile eukaryotic organisms that are not frequently considered the toughest microorganisms in comparison with prokaryotes. Nevertheless extremophilic or extremotolerant species are present also within this group. Here a brief description is provided of the main extreme habitats and the metabolic and physiological modifications adopted by yeasts depending on their adverse conditions. Additionally the main extremophilic and extremotolerant yeast species associated with a few extreme habitats are listed.},

Hill numbers were recently extended to phylogenetic diversity, which incorporates species evolutionary history, as well as to functional diversity, which considers the differences among species traits. We review these extensions and integrate them into a framework of attribute diversity (the effective number of entities or total attribute value) based on Hill numbers of taxonomic entities (species), phylogenetic entities (branches of unit-length), or functional entities (species-pairs with unit-distance between species). This framework unifies ecologists' measures of species diversity, phylogenetic diversity, and distance-based functional diversity. It also provides a unified method of decomposing these diversities and constructing normalized taxonomic, phylogenetic, and functional similarity and differentiation measures, including N-assemblage phylogenetic or functional generalizations of the classic Jaccard, Sørensen, Horn, and Morisita-Horn indexes. A real example shows how this framework extracts ecological meaning from complex data.},

  abstract = {Quantifying and assessing changes in biological diversity are central aspects of many ecological studies, yet accurate methods of estimating biological diversity from sampling data have been elusive. Hill numbers, or the effective number of species, are increasingly used to characterize the taxonomic, phylogenetic, or functional diversity of an assemblage. However, empirical estimates of Hill numbers, including species richness, tend to be an increasing function of sampling effort and, thus, tend to increase with sample completeness. Integrated curves based on sampling theory that smoothly link rarefaction (interpolation) and prediction (extrapolation) standardize samples on the basis of sample size or sample completeness and facilitate the comparison of biodiversity data. Here we extended previous rarefaction and extrapolation models for species richness (Hill number                                q                 D                              , where               q               = 0) to measures of taxon diversity incorporating relative abundance (i.e., for any Hill number                                q                 D                              ,               q               {$>$} 0) and present a unified approach for both individual‐based (abundance) data and sample‐based (incidence) data. Using this unified sampling framework, we derive both theoretical formulas and analytic estimators for seamless rarefaction and extrapolation based on Hill numbers. Detailed examples are provided for the first three Hill numbers:               q               = 0 (species richness),               q               = 1 (the exponential of Shannon's entropy index), and               q               = 2 (the inverse of Simpson's concentration index). We developed a bootstrap method for constructing confidence intervals around Hill numbers, facilitating the comparison of multiple assemblages of both rarefied and extrapolated samples. The proposed estimators are accurate for both rarefaction and short‐range extrapolation. For long‐range extrapolation, the performance of the estimators depends on both the value of               q               and on the extrapolation range. We tested our methods on simulated data generated from species abundance models and on data from large species inventories. We also illustrate the formulas and estimators using empirical data sets from biodiversity surveys of temperate forest spiders and tropical ants.},

  abstract = {Background  The different hypotheses proposed to explain positive species richness–productivity relationships, i.e. selection effect and complementarity effect, imply that plant functional characteristics are at the core of a mechanistic understanding of biodiversity effects. Methodology/Principal Findings  We used two community-wide measures of plant functional composition, (1) community-weighted means of trait values (CWM) and (2) functional trait diversity based on Rao’s quadratic diversity (FDQ) to predict biomass production and measures of biodiversity effects in experimental grasslands (Jena Experiment) with different species richness (2, 4, 8, 16 and 60) and different functional group number and composition (1 to 4; legumes, grasses, small herbs, tall herbs) four years after establishment. Functional trait composition had a larger predictive power for community biomass and measures of biodiversitity effects (40–82\% of explained variation) than species richness per se ({$<$}1–13\% of explained variation). CWM explained a larger amount of variation in community biomass (80\%) and net biodiversity effects (70\%) than FDQ (36 and 38\% of explained variation respectively). FDQ explained similar proportions of variation in complementarity effects (24\%, positive relationship) and selection effects (28\%, negative relationship) as CWM (27\% of explained variation for both complementarity and selection effects), but for all response variables the combination of CWM and FDQ led to significant model improvement compared to a separate consideration of different components of functional trait composition. Effects of FDQ were mainly attributable to diversity in nutrient acquisition and life-history strategies. The large spectrum of traits contributing to positive effects of CWM on biomass production and net biodiversity effects indicated that effects of dominant species were associated with different trait combinations. Conclusions/Significance  Our results suggest that the identification of relevant traits and the relative impacts of functional identity of dominant species and functional diversity are essential for a mechanistic understanding of the role of plant diversity for ecosystem processes such as aboveground biomass production.},

One widespread three‐species interaction involves fungal endophytes infecting grasses and the herbivores that feed upon them. The endophytes are allied with the fungal family Clavicipitaceae and grow systemically in intercellular spaces in above‐ground plant tissues including seeds. Like related               Claviceps               species, the endophytes produce a variety of alkaloids that make the host plants toxic or distasteful to herbivores. A large number of grass species are infected, especially cool‐season grasses in temperate areas. Field and laboratory studies have shown that herbivores avoid infected plants in choice trials and suffer increased mortality and decreased growth on infected grasses in feeding experiments. Resistance to herbivores may provide a selective advantage to infected plants in competitive interactions with noninfected plants. Recent studies have shown that differential herbivory can reverse competitive hierarchies among plant species. Both endophyte‐infected and noninfected tall fescue grass (               Festuca arundinacea               ) are outcompeted by orchardgrass (               Dactylis glomerata               ) in the absence of insect herbivory. However, when herbivores are present infected tall fescue outcompetes orchardgrass. These results suggest that the frequency of infection in grass species and grassland communities will increase over time. Several studies are reviewed illustrating increases in infection frequency within grass populations subject to herbivore pressure. Endophytic fungi may be important regulators of plant‐herbivore interactions and so indirectly affect the structure and dynamics of plant communities.},

  abstract = {The diversity of fungi along environmental gradients has been little explored in contrast to plants and animals. Consequently, environmental factors influencing the composition of fungal assemblages are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine whether the diversity and composition of leaf and root-associated fungal assemblages vary with elevation and to investigate potential explanatory variables. High-throughput sequencing of the Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 region was used to explore fungal assemblages along three elevation gradients, located in French mountainous regions. Beech forest was selected as a study system to minimise the host effect. The variation in species richness and specific composition was investigated for ascomycetes and basidiomycetes assemblages with a particular focus on root-associated ectomycorrhizal fungi. The richness of fungal communities associated with leaves or roots did not significantly relate to any of the tested environmental drivers, i.e. elevation, mean temperature, precipitation or edaphic variables such as soil pH or the ratio carbon∶nitrogen. Nevertheless, the ascomycete species richness peaked at mid-temperature, illustrating a mid-domain effect model. We found that leaf and root-associated fungal assemblages did not follow similar patterns of composition with elevation. While the composition of the leaf-associated fungal assemblage correlated primarily with the mean annual temperature, the composition of root-associated fungal assemblage was explained equally by soil pH and by temperature. The ectomycorrhizal composition was also related to these variables. Our results therefore suggest that above and below-ground fungal assemblages are not controlled by the same main environmental variables. This may be due to the larger amplitude of climatic variables in the tree foliage compared to the soil environment.},

  abstract = {Summary Little is known about the potential effect of climate warming on phyllosphere fungi, despite their important impact on the dynamics and diversity of plant communities. The structure of phyllosphere fungal assemblages along elevation gradients may provide information about this potential effect, because elevation gradients correspond to temperature gradients over short geographic distances. We thus investigated variations in the composition of fungal assemblages inhabiting the phyllosphere of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) at four sites over a gradient of 1000m of elevation in the French Pyrenees Mountains, by using tag-encoded 454 pyrosequencing. Our results show that the composition of fungal assemblages varied significantly between elevation sites, in terms of both the relative abundance and the presence–absence of species, and that the variations in assemblage composition were well correlated with variations in the average temperatures. Our results therefore suggest that climate warming might alter both the incidence and the abundance of phyllosphere fungal species, including potential pathogens. For example, Mycosphaerella punctiformis, a causal agent of leaf spots, showed decreasing abundance with elevation and might therefore shift to higher elevations in response to warming.},

  abstract = {Microorganisms colonizing plant surfaces and internal tissues provide a number of life-support functions for their host. Despite increasing recognition of the vast functional capabilities of the plant microbiome, our understanding of the ecology and evolution of the taxonomically hyperdiverse microbial communities is limited. Here, we review current knowledge of plant genotypic and phenotypic traits as well as allogenic and autogenic factors that shape microbiome composition and functions. We give specific emphasis to the impact of plant domestication on microbiome assembly and how insights into microbiomes of wild plant relatives and native habitats can contribute to reinstate or enrich for microorganisms with beneficial effects on plant growth, development, and health. Finally, we introduce new concepts and perspectives in plant microbiome research, in particular how community ecology theory can provide a mechanistic framework to unravel the interplay of distinct ecological processes?i.e., selection, dispersal, drift, diversification?that structure the plant microbiome.

  abstract = {Ecological divergence is a fundamental source of phenotypic diversity between closely related species, yet the genetic architecture of most ecologically relevant traits is poorly understood. Differences in elevation can impose substantial divergent selection on both complex, correlated suites of traits (such as life-history), as well as novel adaptations. We use the               Mimulus guttatus               species complex to assess if the divergence in elevation is accompanied by trait divergence in a group of closely related perennials and determine the genetic architecture of this divergence. We find that divergence in elevation is associated with differences in life-history, as well as a unique trait, the production of rhizomes. The divergence between two perennials is largely explained by few mid-to-large effect quantitative trait loci (QTLs). However, the presence of QTLs with correlated, but opposing effects on multiple traits leads to some hybrids with transgressive trait combinations. Lastly, we find that the genetic architecture of the ability to produce rhizomes changes through development, wherein most hybrids produce rhizomes, but only later in development. Our results suggest that elevational differences may shape life-history divergence between perennials, but aspects of the genetic architecture of divergence may have implications for hybrid fitness in nature.},

  abstract = {Herbarium specimens represent important records of morphological and genetic diversity of plants that inform questions relevant to global change, including species distributions, phenology and functional traits. It is increasingly appreciated that plant microbiomes can influence these aspects of plant biology, but little is known regarding the historic distribution of microbes associated with plants collected in the pre-molecular age. If microbiomes can be observed reliably in herbarium specimens, researchers will gain a new lens with which to examine microbial ecology, evolution, species interactions. Here, we describe a method for accessing historical plant microbiomes from preserved herbarium specimens, providing a proof of concept using two plant taxa from the imperiled boreal biome (               Andromeda polifolia               and               Ledum palustre               subsp               . groenlandicum,               Ericaceae). We focus on fungal endophytes, which occur within symptomless plant tissues such as leaves. Through a three-part approach (i.e. culturing, cloning and next-generation amplicon sequencing via the Illumina MiSeq platform, with extensive controls), we examined endophyte communities in dried, pressed leaves that had been processed as regular herbarium specimens and stored at room temperature in a herbarium for four years               .               We retrieved only one endophyte in culture, but cloning and especially the MiSeq analysis revealed a rich community of foliar endophytes. The phylogenetic distribution and diversity of endophyte assemblages, especially among the Ascomycota, resemble endophyte communities from fresh plants collected in the boreal biome. We could distinguish communities of endophytes in each plant species and differentiate likely endophytes from fungi that could be surface contaminants. Taxa found by cloning were observed in the larger MiSeq dataset, but species richness was greater when subsets of the same tissues were evaluated with the MiSeq approach. Our findings provide a proof of concept for capturing endophyte DNA from herbarium specimens, supporting the importance of herbarium records as roadmaps for understanding the dynamics of plant-associated microbial biodiversity in the Anthropocene.

HPLC assays of ergosterol (fungal biomass) and amplicon pyrosequencing of the ITS2 region of rDNA were used to investigate how the fungal communities associated with four bryophyte species changed across an elevational gradient transitioning from conifer forest to the lowalpine. Fungal biomass and OTU richness associated with the four moss hosts did not vary significantly across the gradient (P {$>$} 0.05), and both were more strongly affected by host and tissue type. Despite largely constant levels of fungal biomass, distinct shifts in community composition of fungi associated with Hylocomium, Pleurozium and Polytrichum occurred between the elevation zones of the gradient. This likely is a result of influence on fungal communities by major environmental factors such as temperature, directly or indirectly mediated by, or interacting with, the response of other components of the vegetation (i.e. the dominant trees). Fungal communities associated with Dicranum were an exception, exhibiting spatial autocorrelation between plots, and no significant structuring by elevation. Nevertheless, the detection of distinct fungal assemblages associated with a single host growing in different elevation zones along an elevational gradient is of particular relevance in the light of the ongoing changes in vegetation patterns in boreal and alpine systems due to global climate warming.},

From the samples of snow, 234 fungal isolates were obtained and could be assigned to 51 taxa of 26 genera. Eleven yeast species displayed the highest densities; among them, Phenoliferia glacialis showed a broad distribution and was detected at all sites that were sampled. Fungi known to be opportunistic in humans were subjected to antifungal minimal inhibition concentration. Debaryomyces hansenii, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa, Penicillium chrysogenum, Penicillium sp. 3, and Penicillium sp. 4 displayed resistance against the antifungals benomyl and fluconazole. Among them, R. mucilaginosa isolates were able to grow at 37 °C. Our results show that the winter seasonal snow of the Antarctic Peninsula contains a diverse fungal community dominated by cosmopolitan ubiquitous fungal species previously found in tropical, temperate, and polar ecosystems. The high densities of these cosmopolitan fungi suggest that they could be present in the air that arrives at the Antarctic Peninsula by air masses from outside Antarctica. Additionally, we detected environmental fungal isolates that were resistant to agricultural and clinical antifungals and able to grow at 37 °C. Further studies will be needed to characterize the virulence potential of these fungi in humans and animals.},

However, identifying the underlying genetic loci controlling microbial selection remains challenging. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) represent a potentially powerful, unbiased method to identify microbes sensitive to the host genotype and to connect them with the genetic loci that influence their colonization. Here, we conducted a population-level microbiome analysis of the rhizospheres of 200 sorghum genotypes. Using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we identify rhizosphere-associated bacteria exhibiting heritable associations with plant genotype, and identify significant overlap between these lineages and heritable taxa recently identified in maize. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GWAS can identify host loci that correlate with the abundance of specific subsets of the rhizosphere microbiome. Finally, we demonstrate that these results can be used to predict rhizosphere microbiome structure for an independent panel of sorghum genotypes based solely on knowledge of host genotypic information.},

  author = {{Diem Nguyen} and Nguyen, Diem},
  date = {2015-01-01},
  abstract = {European forest ecosystems span many different ecological zones and are rich in tree species. The environment in which the trees grow similarly affects fungal communities that interact with these trees. Fungal pathogens can cause severe damage to trees and potentially impair forest stability. In particular, pathogens that damage the foliage will affect the tree’s photosynthetic ability, partly or completely. At the same time, pathogens can create niches for different plants by removing dominant species. The foliage community also comprises fungal species whose ecological functions are not entirely known and may either positively or negatively impact the tree’s health status. The aim of this thesis was to understand the effect of tree species diversity in mitigating fungal pathogen damage and in affecting the fungal community distribution. To achieve this, visual assessment of leaves for pathogen damages was carried out on 16 different tree species from six European forests. The fungal communities of Norway spruce needles from four European forests were studied by using next generation sequencing technology, and fungal communities of birch leaves by sequencing and morphological assessment. In this thesis, foliar fungal pathogen damages were positively correlated with tree species richness – latitude interaction, suggesting that tree species diversity may regulate pathogens but was dependent on the forest. Additionally, foliar fungal community composition was found to differ significantly in different forests, which may be attributable to local environmental effects or reflect the evolutionary history of the host tree, and thereby this study contributes to the understanding of biogeographic patterns of microorganisms. Finally, methods used to study fungal communities revealed that the sequencing-based method provided a richer picture of the fungal community than morphological assessment of fungal structures and symptoms, though neither method informed the distribution patterns as it relates to tree species diversity. Overall, impact of tree species diversity on foliar fungal distribution may not be strong, but it invites us to consider other factors that interact with fungal communities and how fungi may in turn shape their environment.},

Recent work has shown that damage by leaf-cutting ants, a major Neotropical defoliator, is reduced to almost half in plants with high densities of endophytes. We investigated changes in the phenotype of leaves that could influence ants' behavior to result in the reduction of foliar damage. We produced cucumber seedlings with high and low densities of one common endophyte species, Colletotrichum tropicale. We used the leaves in bioassays and to compare chemical and physical leaf characteristics important for ants' food selection. Ants cut about one-third more area of cucumber leaves with lower densities of endophytes and removed c. 20\% more paper disks impregnated with the extracts of those leaves compared with leaves and disks from plants hosting the fungus. Colletotrichum tropicale colonization did not cause detectable changes in the composition of volatile compounds, cuticular waxes, nutrients or leaf toughness.

In plants, local speciation, where small populations split off from a large-ranged progenitor species, is thought to be the dominant mode, yet there are still few examples to verify speciation has occurred in this manner. A recently described morphological species in the yellow monkey flowers, Mimulus filicifolius, is an excellent candidate for local speciation because of its highly restricted geographical range. Mimulus filicifolius was formerly identified as a population of M. laciniatus due to similar lobed leaf morphology and rocky outcrop habitat. To investigate whether M. filicifolius is genetically divergent and reproductively isolated from M. laciniatus, we examined patterns of genetic diversity in ten nuclear and eight microsatellite loci, and hybrid fertility in M. filicifolius and its purported close relatives: M. laciniatus, M. guttatus and M. nasutus. We found that M. filicifolius is genetically divergent from the other species and strongly reproductively isolated from M. laciniatus. We conclude that M. filicifolius is an independent rock outcrop specialist despite being morphologically and ecologically similar to M. laciniatus, and that its small geographical range nested within other wide-ranging members of the M. guttatus species complex is consistent with local speciation.},

However, knowledge of the genetic architecture of leaf shape variation in natural populations remains limited.

Lobed and narrow leaves have evolved from the entire, round leaves of M. guttatus in M. laciniatus, M. nudatus and a polymorphic serpentine M. guttatus population (M2L). Methods Bulk segregant analysis and next-generation sequencing were used to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that underlie leaf shape in an M. laciniatus∈×∈M. guttatus F2 population. To determine whether the same QTLs contribute to leaf shape variation in M. nudatus and M2L, F2s from M. guttatus∈×∈M. nudatus and lobed M2L∈×∈unlobed M. guttatus crosses were genotyped at QTLs from the bulk segregant analysis. Key Results Narrow and lobed leaf shapes in M. laciniatus, M. nudatus and M. guttatus are controlled by overlapping genetic regions. Several promising leaf shape candidate genes were found under each QTL. Conclusions The evolution of divergent leaf shape has taken place multiple times in the M. guttatus species complex and is associated with the occupation of dry, rocky environments. The genetic architecture of elongated and lobed leaves is similar across three species in this group. This may indicate that parallel genetic evolution from standing variation or new mutations is responsible for the putatively adaptive leaf shape variation in Mimulus.},

  abstract = {Identifying the individual loci and mutations that underlie adaptation to extreme environments has long been a goal of evolutionary biology. However, finding the genes that underlie adaptive traits is difficult for several reasons. First, because many traits and genes evolve simultaneously as populations diverge, it is difficult to disentangle adaptation from neutral demographic processes. Second, finding the individual loci involved in any trait is challenging given the respective limitations of quantitative and population genetic methods. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Hendrick et al. (2016) overcome these difficulties and determine the genetic basis of microgeographic adaptation between geothermal vent and nonthermal populations of Mimulus guttatus in Yellowstone National Park. The authors accomplish this by combining population and quantitative genetic techniques, a powerful, but labour-intensive, strategy for identifying individual causative adaptive loci that few studies have used (Stinchcombe \& Hoekstra ). In a previous common garden experiment (Lekberg et al. 2012), thermal M. guttatus populations were found to differ from their closely related nonthermal neighbours in various adaptive phenotypes including trichome density. Hendrick et al. (2016) combine quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping, population genomic scans for selection and admixture mapping to identify a single genetic locus underlying differences in trichome density between thermal and nonthermal M. guttatus. The candidate gene, R2R3 MYB, is homologous to genes involved in trichome development across flowering plants. The major trichome QTL, Tr14, is also involved in trichome density differences in an independent M. guttatus population comparison (Holeski et al. 2010) making this an example of parallel genetic evolution.},

  abstract = {The genetic architecture of local adaptation has been of central interest to evolutionary biologists since the modern synthesis. In addition to classic theory on the effect size of adaptive mutations by Fisher, Kimura and Orr, recent theory addresses the genetic architecture of local adaptation in the face of ongoing gene flow. This theory predicts that with substantial gene flow between populations local adaptation should proceed primarily through mutations of large effect or tightly linked clusters of smaller effect loci. In this study, we investigate the genetic architecture of divergence in flowering time, mating system-related traits, and leaf shape between Mimulus laciniatus and a sympatric population of its close relative M. guttatus. These three traits are probably involved in M. laciniatus' adaptation to a dry, exposed granite outcrop environment. Flowering time and mating system differences are also reproductive isolating barriers making them 'magic traits'. Phenotypic hybrids in this population provide evidence of recent gene flow. Using next-generation sequencing, we generate dense SNP markers across the genome and map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) involved in flowering time, flower size and leaf shape. We find that interspecific divergence in all three traits is due to few QTL of large effect including a highly pleiotropic QTL on chromosome 8. This QTL region contains the pleiotropic candidate gene TCP4 and is involved in ecologically important phenotypes in other Mimulus species. Our results are consistent with theory, indicating that local adaptation and reproductive isolation with gene flow should be due to few loci with large and pleiotropic effects.},

Here, we investigate the ecological variables and traits that underlie Mimulus laciniatus’ adaptation to granite outcrops compared to its sympatric, mesic-adapted progenitor, Mimulus guttatus. We use fine-scale measurements of soil moisture and herbivory to examine differences in selective forces between the species’ habitats, and measure selection on flowering time, flower size, plant height, and leaf shape in a reciprocal transplant using M. laciniatus × M. guttatus F4 hybrids. We find that differences in drought and herbivory drive survival differences between habitats, that M. laciniatus and M. guttatus are each better adapted to their native habitat, and differential habitat selection on flowering time, plant stature, and leaf shape. Although early flowering time, small stature, and lobed leaf shape underlie plant fitness in M. laciniatus’ seasonally dry environment, increased plant size is advantageous in a competitive mesic environment replete with herbivores like M. guttatus’. Given that we observed divergent selection between habitats in the direction of species differences, we conclude that adaptation to different microhabitats is an important component of reproductive isolation in this sympatric species pair.},

Whether these phenotypic changes are directly caused by climate change, and whether they result from phenotypic plasticity or evolution, are active areas of investigation. Here, we review terrestrial plant studies addressing these questions. Plastic and evolutionary responses to climate change are clearly occurring. Of the 38 studies that met our criteria for inclusion, all found plastic or evolutionary responses, with 26 studies showing both. These responses, however, may be insufficient to keep pace with climate change, as indicated by eight of 12 studies that examined this directly. There is also mixed evidence for whether evolutionary responses are adaptive, and whether they are directly caused by contemporary climatic changes. We discuss factors that will likely influence the extent of plastic and evolutionary responses, including patterns of environmental changes, species’ life history characteristics including generation time and breeding system, and degree and direction of gene flow. Future studies with standardized methodologies, especially those that use direct approaches assessing responses to climate change over time, and sharing of data through public databases, will facilitate better predictions of the capacity for plant populations to respond to rapid climate change.},

These primers, ITS1‐F and ITS4‐B, were intended to be specific to fungi and basidiomycetes, respectively. We have tested the specificity of these primers against 13 species of ascomycetes, 14 of basidiomycetes, and 15 of plants. Our results showed that ITS4‐B, when paired with either a ‘universal’ primer ITS1 or the fungal‐specific primer ITS1‐F, efficiently amplified DNA from all basidiomycetes and discriminated against ascomycete DNAs. The results with plants were not as clearcut. The ITS1‐F/ITS4‐B primer pair produced a small amount of PCR product for certain plant species, but the quantity was in most cases less than that produced by the ‘universal’ ITS primers. However, under conditions where both plant and fungal DNAs were present, the fungal DNA was amplified to the apparent exclusion of plant DNA. ITS1‐F/ITS4‐B preferential amplification was shown to be particularly useful for detection and analysis of the basidiomycete component in ectomycorrhizae and in rust‐infected tissues. These primers can be used to study the structure of ectomycorrhizal communities or the distribution of rusts on alternate hosts.},

  abstract = {•               Premise of the study:               Fungal endophytes are symbionts that inhabit aboveground tissues of most terrestrial plants and can affect plant physiology and growth under stressed conditions. In a future faced with substantial climate change, endophytes have the potential to play an important role in plant stress resistance. Understanding both the distributions of endophytes and their functioning in symbiosis with plants are key aspects of predicting their role in an altered climate.                                         •               Methods:               Here we characterized endophytes in grasses across a steep precipitation gradient to examine the relative importance of environmental and spatial factors in structuring endophyte communities. We also tested how 20 endophytes isolated from drier and wetter regions performed in symbiosis with grass seedlings under high and low soil moisture in the greenhouse.                                         •               Key results:               Environmental factors related to historical and current precipitation were the most important predictors of endophyte communities in the field. On average, endophytic fungi from western sites also reduced plant water loss in the greenhouse compared to fungi from eastern sites. However, there was substantial variability in how individual endophytic taxa affected plant traits under high and low water availability, with up to two orders of magnitude difference in the plasticity of plant traits conferred by the different fungal taxa.                                         •               Conclusions:               While species sorting appears to largely explain local endophyte community composition, their function in symbiosis is not predictable from local environmental conditions. The development of a predictive framework for endophyte function will require further study of individual fungal taxa and genotypes across environmental gradients.},

Previous studies have found correlations between climate and endophyte beta diversity, but were unable to clearly separate drivers related to long-term climate, annual weather, and host plants. To address this, we characterized endophyte communities in the perennial C-4 grass, Panicum hallii, across a precipitation gradient in central Texas over 3 years. A total of 65 unique leaf endophytes were isolated and identified based on ITS and LSU regions of rDNA. Mean annual rainfall and temperature were the primary drivers of endophyte richness and community composition, followed by annual weather conditions. In contrast, little explanatory value was provided by plant host traits, vegetation structure, or spatial factors. The importance of historical climate and annual weather in endophyte distributions suggests that species sort by environment and are likely to be affected by future climate change.

Here, we examined three paradigms that potentially control how endophytes affect plant hosts: habitat adaptation, evolutionary history and functional traits.

Overall, survival was higher for plants grown with more stress‐tolerant fungi, and aboveground biomass was enhanced by fungi from warmer and drier habitats. Plant growth and physiology were also dependent on fungal resource use indicators; however, specific predictors were dependent on water availability.                                                     Simple ecological traits of foliar endophytic fungi observed in culture can translate to symbiotic lifestyles.

Endophytic fungi associated with healthy leaves may play an important role in the protection of hosts against herbivores and pathogens. In this study, the diversity of foliar endophytic fungi (FEF) of the southern temperate tree Embothrium coccineum (Proteaceae), as well as their role in plant protection in nature was determined. Fungal endophytes were isolated from 40 asymptomatic leaves by the culture method for molecular identification of the 18S rRNA gene. A relationship between FEF frequency and plant protection was evaluated in juveniles of E. coccineum . Fungal endophyte frequency was estimated using real-time PCR analyses to determine endophyte DNA content per plant. A total of 178 fungal isolates were identified, with sequence data revealing 34 different operational taxonomic units (OTUs). A few common taxa dominated the fungal endophyte community, whereas most taxa qualified as rare. A significant positive correlation between plant protection (evaluated in terms of percentage of leaf damage) and FEF frequency was found. Furthermore, in vitro confrontation assays indicated that FEF were able to inhibit the growth of fungal pathogens. The data showed a relatively high diversity of fungal endophytes associated with leaves of E. coccineum , and suggest a positive relationship between fungal endophyte frequencies in leaves and host protection in nature.},

Given that endophytes in woody plants are predominantly horizontally transmitted, fungal endophyte colonization of foliar tissues is likely to be influenced by plant resistance traits. Here, we evaluated the association between leaf resistance traits and colonization and community composition of horizontally transmitted endophytes (HTE) in 10 dominant trees species in a temperate rainforest in Southern Chile. Because resistance traits might restrict colonization of HTE, it was hypothesized that host trees with similar leaf resistance traits would show similar HTE communities.                                                     We measured leaf traits with reported roles in plant resistance against pathogens and/or herbivores: cell wall polysaccharides, leaf toughness, flavonoids, anthocyanins, terpenoids and chitinases. We also determined variation in fungal read counts, number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), diversity and community structure across tree species. Foliar fungal endophyte communities were characterized using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of tagged amplicons of the ITS1 region.                                                                          Fungal read counts were significantly different among host trees, while number of OTUs and diversity were similar among them. Multivariate analyses showed that community composition of endophytic fungi significantly differed among hosts, and that variation in cell wall, flavonoids, anthocyanins and terpenoids was associated with differences in HTE communities. We found that host trees sharing leaf resistance traits harbour similar HTE communities. Fungal read counts decreased with increasing content of cell wall polysaccharides, while endophyte diversity decreased with increasing anthocyanin levels. Fungal read counts, in contrast, were positively associated with terpenoids. Additionally, culture‐based data indicated that some HTE strains inhibited the growth of the common fungal pathogen                     Botrytis cinerea                     .                                                                                             Synthesis                     . Overall, we found that leaf resistance traits may influence fungal endophyte colonization and community composition in tree species, likely through deterrent effects of structural and chemical traits. We suggest that endophytic fungi that overcome resistance traits might play a role in plant protection.},

Leaf functional traits (LFTs) regulate FE entry, colonization and community composition in plants.                                                     There is evidence that thin leaves with less structural and chemical traits but high nutrient content are more prone to FE colonization than well‐defended thick leaves. This illustrates the relevance of trade‐offs (= an increase in a trait, with a decrease in another trait) in LFTs, suggesting that the leaf economics spectrum (LES, which describes relationships in a suite of leaf traits aligned from a resource‐acquisitive to a resource‐conservative ecological strategy) may be a predictor of FE colonization and community composition in plants.                                                     We hypothesize that LES‐modulated changes in the leaf internal environment (i.e. thin, low‐defended vs. thick, well‐defended leaves) will (a) have consequences for host resistance to pathogens due to changes in the FE colonization and diversity and, subsequently, in the foliar chemical profile and (b) may cause a switch in FE behaviour to a pathogenic lifestyle.                                                                          Synthesis                     . Still, our knowledge of how the coexistence between host plants and FE is regulated remains limited. LFTs may act as relevant ecological hub of FE colonization, community composition and life behaviour in natural ecosystems, with potential bottom‐up effects on other organisms, including pathogens. We highlight and discuss critical aspects in this topic and end by proposing new avenues of research in this emerging field.},

  abstract = {Plant microbiota can greatly impact plant growth, defense, and health in different environments. Thus, it might be evolutionarily beneficial for plants to be able to control processes related to microbiota assembly. Dioecious plant species display sexual dimorphism in morphology, physiology, and immunity. These differences imply that male and female individuals might differently regulate their microbiota, but the role of sex in microbiota assembly has been largely neglected so far. Here, we introduce the mechanism of how sex controls microbiota in plants analogically to the sex regulation of gut microbiota in animals, in particular in humans. We argue that plant sex imposes selective pressure on filtering and constructing microbiota in the rhizosphere, phyllosphere, and endosphere along the soil-plant continuum. Since male plants are more resistant than female plants to environmental stresses, we suggest that a male host forms more stable and resistant plant microbiota that cooperate more effectively with the host to resist stresses. Male and female plants can distinguish whether a plant is of the same or different sex, and males can alleviate stress-caused damage in females. The impact of a male host on microbiota would protect female plants from unfavorable environments.},

Endophytes have received much attention over the past few decades, yet many questions remain unanswered regarding patterns in their biodiversity at local to global scales. To characterize research effort to date, we synthesized results from \textasciitilde 600 published studies. Our survey revealed a global research interest and highlighted several gaps in knowledge. For instance, of the 17 biomes encompassed by our survey, 7 were understudied and together composed only 7\% of the studies that we considered. We found that fungal endophyte diversity has been characterized in at least one host from 30\% of embryophyte families, while bacterial endophytes have been surveyed in hosts from only 10.5\% of families. We complimented our survey with a vote counting procedure to determine endophyte richness patterns among plant tissue types. We found that variation in endophyte assemblages in above‐ground tissues varied with host growth habit. Stems were the richest tissue in woody plants, whereas roots were the richest tissue in graminoids. For forbs, we found no consistent differences in relative tissue richness among studies. We propose future directions to fill the gaps in knowledge we uncovered and inspire further research.},

The immune system can promote stability in the composition of the microbiome by reshaping the ecological dynamics of its members, but the degree of stability will depend on the interplay between ecological context, immune system development, and higher-order microbe-microbe interactions. The eco-evolutionary interplay affecting composition and stability should inform the strategies used to engineer new functions in the microbiome. We conclude with recent methodological developments that provide an important path forward for both engineering new functionality in the microbiome and broadly understanding how ecological interactions shape evolutionary processes in complex biological systems.},

However grasses first arose in tropical forests, where they remain a significant and diverse component of understory and forest-edge communities. To provide a broader context for understanding grass-endophyte associations we characterized fungal endophyte communities inhabiting foliage of 11 species of phylogenetically diverse C3 grasses in the understory of a lowland tropical forest at Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Our sample included members of early-arising subfamilies of Poaceae that are endemic to forests, as well as more recently arising subfamilies that transitioned to open environments. Isolation on culture media and direct PCR and cloning revealed that these grasses harbor species-rich and phylogenetically diverse communities that lack the endophytic Clavicipitaceae known from diverse woodland and pasture grasses in the temperate zone. Both the incidence and diversity of endophytes was consistent among grass species regardless of subfamily, clade affiliation or ancestral habitat use. Genotype and phylogenetic analyses suggest that these endophytic fungi are predominantly host generalists, shared not only among distinctive lineages of Poaceae but also with non-grass plants at the same site. © 2011 by The Mycological Society of America.},

In contrast to previous studies, we found no evidence for host- or habitat specificity. Instead, endophytes demonstrated strong spatial structure consistent with dispersal limitation, with community similarity decaying markedly over a scale of hundreds of meters. Spatial structure that is independent of host species and habitat reveals remarkable heterogeneity of endophyte-host associations at small geographic scales and adds an important spatial component to extrapolative estimates of fungal diversity. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological Society.},

We characterized the genetics of developmental variation and phenotypic plasticity in trichome density, a putative defensive trait of Mimulus guttatus (yellow monkeyflower). Our results are evaluated in relation to the optimal defense theory, which provides testable predictions for plastic and developmental patterns in defense traits. We found that both developmental stage and simulated insect damage affected trichome production, but in different ways. Plants were more likely to produce at least some trichomes on later leaves than on earlier leaves, regardless of damage. Damage did not affect the average probability of producing trichomes, but it did increase the density of hairs on trichome-positive plants. We mapped trichome quantitative trait loci (QTL) by selectively genotyping a large panel of recombinant inbred lines derived from two highly divergent populations. Several highly pleiotropic QTL influenced multiple aspects of the trichome phenotype (constitutive, developmental, and/or plastic responses). Only one of the QTL influenced trichome induction following damage. In a result that is consistent with a central prediction of optimal defense theory, the high allele at this location was from the ancestral population with low constitutive trichome production. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.},

However, vast library size variations across samples present great challenges for proper statistical comparisons. To deal with these challenges, rarefaction is often used in practice as a normalization technique, although there has been debate whether rarefaction should ever be used. Conventional wisdom and previous work suggested that rarefaction should never be used in practice, arguing that rarefying microbiome data is statistically inadmissible. These discussions, however, have been confined to particular parametric models and simulation studies.                                         Results               We develop a semiparametric graphical model framework for grouped microbiome data and analyze in the context of differential abundance testing the statistical trade-offs of the rarefaction procedure, accounting for latent variations and measurement errors. Under the framework, it can be shown rarefaction guarantees that subsequent permutation tests properly control the Type I error. In addition, the loss in sensitivity from rarefaction is solely due to increased measurement error; if the underlying variation in microbial composition is large among samples, rarefaction might not hurt subsequent statistical inference much. We develop the rarefaction efficiency index (REI) as an indicator for efficiency loss and illustrate it with a dataset on the effect of storage conditions for microbiome data. Simulation studies based on real data demonstrate that the impact of rarefaction on sensitivity is negligible when overdispersion is prominent, while low REI corresponds to scenarios in which rarefying might substantially lower the statistical power. Whether to rarefy or not ultimately depends on assumptions of the data generating process and characteristics of the data.

  abstract = {Aim Ecologists have generally agreed that -diversity is driven at least in part by ecological processes and mechanisms of community assembly and is a key determinant of global patterns of species richness. This idea has been challenged by a recent study based on an individual-based null model approach, which aims to account for the species pool. The goal of the present study is twofold: (1) to analyse data sets from different parts of the world to determine whether there are significant latitude-diversity gradients after accounting for the species pool, and (2) to evaluate the validity of the null model. Location Global. Methods A total of 257 forest plots, each being 0.1 ha in size and having 10 0.01-ha subplots, were used. We conducted four sets of analyses. A modified version of Whittaker's -diversity index was used to quantify -diversity for each forest plot. A randomization procedure was used to determine expected -diversity. Results The number of individuals per species, which characterizes species abundance distribution, alone explains 56.884.2\% of the variation in observed -diversity. Species pool (-diversity) explained only an additional 2.615.2\% of the variation in observed -diversity. Latitude explains 18.6\% of the variation in raw deviation in Gentry's global data set, and explains 11.011.6\% of the variation in standardized deviation in the global and three regional analyses. Latitude explains 33.246.2\% of the variation in the number of individuals per species. Main conclusions Species abundance distribution, rather than species pool size, plays a key role in driving latitude-diversity gradients for -diversity in local forest communities. The individual-based null model is not a valid null model for investigating -diversity gradients driven by mechanisms of local community assembly because the null model incorporates species abundance distributions, which are driven by mechanisms of local community assembly and in turn generate -diversity gradients.},

  abstract = {Despite long-standing interest in elevational-diversity gradients, little is known about the processes that cause changes in the compositional variation of communities (β-diversity) across elevations. Recent studies have suggested that β-diversity gradients are driven by variation in species pools, rather than by variation in the strength of local community assembly mechanisms such as dispersal limitation, environmental filtering, or local biotic interactions. However, tests of this hypothesis have been limited to very small spatial scales that limit inferences about how the relative importance of assembly mechanisms may change across spatial scales. Here, we test the hypothesis that scale-dependent community assembly mechanisms shape biogeographic β-diversity gradients using one of the most well-characterized elevational gradients of tropical plant diversity. Using an extensive dataset on woody plant distributions along a 4,000-m elevational gradient in the Bolivian Andes, we compared observed patterns of β-diversity to null-model expectations. β-deviations (standardized differences from null values) were used to measure the relative effects of local community assembly mechanisms after removing sampling effects caused by variation in species pools. To test for scale-dependency, we compared elevational gradients at two contrasting spatial scales that differed in the size of local assemblages and regions by at least an order of magnitude. Elevational gradients in β-diversity persisted after accounting for regional variation in species pools. Moreover, the elevational gradient in β-deviations changed with spatial scale. At small scales, local assembly mechanisms were detectable, but variation in species pools accounted for most of the elevational gradient in β-diversity. At large spatial scales, in contrast, local assembly mechanisms were a dominant force driving changes in β-diversity. In contrast to the hypothesis that variation in species pools alone drives β-diversity gradients, we show that local community assembly mechanisms contribute strongly to systematic changes in β-diversity across elevations. We conclude that scale-dependent variation in community assembly mechanisms underlies these iconic gradients in global biodiversity.},

More importantly, the dominant assembly processes that drive altitudinal variations in both taxonomic composition and functional structure remain unclear. To fill the gaps, we integrated soil prokaryotic taxonomic community structure, functional community structure and community assembly processes along an altitudinal gradient into a comprehensive understanding. The results revealed that both taxonomic community structure and core functional community structure of soil prokaryotic microbes significantly differed across altitudes. We detected the core functional groups associated with the redox reactions essential for microbial metabolism and biogeochemical cycles across altitudes. Chemoheterotrophy and photoautotrophy were dominant in abundance, indicating the important roles of primary energy metabolism for soil prokaryotic community. The whole prokaryotic community taxonomic composition was dominantly shaped by dispersal limitation (governing 74\% of spatial turnover). The variation of functional structure was primarily caused by environmental selection, while the taxonomic variation within individual functional groups was weakly related to selection but mainly driven by drift. These results are critical for predicting the future dynamics of soil microbial community in the face of disturbances.},

  abstract = {Entropies such as the Shannon–Wiener and Gini–Simpson indices are not themselves diversities. Conversion of these to effective number of species is the key to a unified and intuitive interpretation of diversity. Effective numbers of species derived from standard diversity indices share a common set of intuitive mathematical properties and behave as one would expect of a diversity, while raw indices do not. Contrary to Keylock, the lack of concavity of effective numbers of species is irrelevant as long as they are used as transformations of concave alpha, beta, and gamma entropies. The practical importance of this transformation is demonstrated by applying it to a popular community similarity measure based on raw diversity indices or entropies. The standard similarity measure based on untransformed indices is shown to give misleading results, but transforming the indices or entropies to effective numbers of species produces a stable, easily interpreted, sensitive general similarity measure. General overlap measures derived from this transformed similarity measure yield the Jaccard index, Sørensen index, Horn index of overlap, and the Morisita–Horn index as special cases.},

  abstract = {Climate is a potent selective force in natural populations, yet the importance of adaptation in the response of plant species to past climate change has been questioned. As many species are unlikely to migrate fast enough to track the rapidly changing climate of the future, adaptation must play an increasingly important role in their response. In this paper we review recent work that has documented climate-related genetic diversity within populations or on the microgeographical scale. We then describe studies that have looked at the potential evolutionary responses of plant populations to future climate change. We argue that in fragmented landscapes, rapid climate change has the potential to overwhelm the capacity for adaptation in many plant populations and dramatically alter their genetic composition. The consequences are likely to include unpredictable changes in the presence and abundance of species within communities and a reduction in their ability to resist and recover from further environmental perturbations, such as pest and disease outbreaks and extreme climatic events. Overall, a range-wide increase in extinction risk is likely to result. We call for further research into understanding the causes and consequences of the maintenance and loss of climate-related genetic diversity within populations. ©2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

Altitudinal gradient studies and warming experiments can both increase understanding of climate effects on species interactions, but few studies have used both together to improve predictions. We examined whether plant–fungal symbioses responded similarly to altitude and 23yr of experimental warming. Root‐ and leaf‐associated fungi, which can mediate plants’ climate sensitivity, responded divergently to elevation vs. warming. Fungal colonization, diversity, and composition varied with altitude, but climate variables were generally weak predictors; other factors such as host plant identity, plant community composition, or edaphic variables likely drive fungal altitudinal distributions. Manipulated warming altered fungal colonization, but not composition or diversity. Leaf symbionts were more sensitive to climate and experimental warming than root symbionts. Altitudinal patterns and responses to warming differed among host plant species and fungal groups, indicating that predicting climate effects on symbioses will require tracking both host and symbiont identities. Combining experimental and observational methods can yield valuable insight into how climate change may alter plant–symbiont interactions, but our results indicate that altitude does not always serve as an adequate proxy for warming effects on fungal symbionts of plants.},

  abstract = {Background and AimsLeaf life span is widely recognized as a key life history trait associated with herbivory resistance, but rigorous comparative data are rare for seedlings. The goal of this study was to examine how light environment affects leaf life span, and how ontogenetic development during the first year may influence leaf fracture toughness, lamina density and stem density that are relevant for herbivory resistance, leaf life span and seedling survival.MethodsData from three experiments encompassing 104 neotropical woody species were combined. Leaf life span, lamina and vein fracture toughness, leaf and stem tissue density and seedling survival were quantified for the first-year seedlings at standardized ontogenetic stages in shade houses and common gardens established in gaps and shaded understorey in a moist tropical forest in Panama. Mortality of naturally recruited seedlings till 1 year later was quantified in 800 1-m2 plots from 1994 to 2011.Key ResultsMedian leaf life span ranged widely among species, always greater in shade (ranging from 151 to {$>$}1790 d in the understorey and shade houses) than in gaps (115-867 d), but with strong correlation between gaps and shade. Leaf and stem tissue density increased with seedling age, whereas leaf fracture toughness showed only a weak increase. All these traits were positively correlated with leaf life span. Leaf life span and stem density were negatively correlated with seedling mortality in shade, while gap mortality showed no correlation with these traits.ConclusionsThe wide spectrum of leaf life span and associated functional traits reflects variation in shade tolerance of first-year seedlings among coexisting trees, shrubs and lianas in this neotropical forest. High leaf tissue density is important in enhancing leaf toughness, a known physical defence, and leaf life span. Both seedling leaf life span and stem density should be considered as key functional traits that contribute to seedling survival in tropical forest understoreys. © The Author 2013.},

  abstract = {While direct plant responses to global change have been well characterized, indirect plant responses to global change, via altered species interactions, have received less attention. Here, we examined how plants associated with four classes of fungal symbionts (class I leaf endophytes [EF], arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi [AMF], ectomycorrhizal fungi [ECM], and dark septate endophytes [DSE]) responded to four global change factors (enriched CO               2               , drought, N deposition, and warming). We performed a meta‐analysis of 434 studies spanning 174 publications to search for generalizable trends in responses of plant–fungal symbioses to future environments. Specifically, we addressed the following questions: (1) Can fungal symbionts ameliorate responses of plants to global change? (2) Do fungal symbiont groups differ in the degree to which they modify plant response to global change? (3) Do particular global change factors affect plant–fungal symbioses more than others? In all global change scenarios, except elevated CO               2               , fungal symbionts significantly altered plant responses to global change. In most cases, fungal symbionts increased plant biomass in response to global change. However, increased N deposition reduced the benefits of symbiosis. Of the global change factors we considered, drought and N deposition resulted in the strongest fungal mediation of plant responses. Our analysis highlighted gaps in current knowledge for responses of particular fungal groups and revealed the importance of considering not only the nonadditive effects of multiple global change factors, but also the interactive effects of multiple fungal symbioses. Our results show that considering plant–fungal symbioses is critical to predicting ecosystem response to global change.},

Because many of these fungi have only recently been discovered and sequenced, the independent and interactive responses of plants and their fungal symbionts to a warming climate is an area of active research. Here we describe a conceptual framework linking the range of phenotypic plasticity and rates of shifts in community composition of each symbiont (plants and fungal leaf endophytes) to overall changes in abundance of each organism in a 26-year-long warming experiment in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. In this system, leaf endophytic fungi exhibit large plasticity in growth rates in response to experimental warming in the laboratory, but no shifts in composition after 26years of warming in the field. Instead, fungal composition in the field changed in response to plant species composition. In contrast, the C3 grasses examined in this study shifted in composition in response to field warming within 4years. In addition, the abundance of individual fungi was much more variable among field temperatures than that of plants. Overall, we find support that fungi are potentially more phenotypically plastic in response to warming whereas plants are more likely to shift composition.},

Fungal mutualists should be the most beneficial in abiotically stressful environments, and the structure of networks of plant-fungal interactions likely shift along gradients, even when fungal community composition does not track environmental stress. We sampled 634 unique combinations of fungal endophytes and mycorrhizal fungi, grass species identities, and sampling locations from 66 sites across six replicate altitudinal gradients in the western Colorado Rocky Mountains. The diversity and composition of leaf endophytic, root endophytic, and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal guilds and the overall abundance of fungal functional groups (pathogens, saprotrophs, mutualists) tracked grass host identity more closely than elevation. Network structures of root endophytes become more nested and less specialized at higher elevations, but network structures of other fungal guilds did not vary with elevation. Overall, grass species identity had overriding influence on the diversity and composition of above- and belowground fungal endophytes and AM fungi, despite large environmental variation. Therefore, in our system climate change may rarely directly affect fungal symbionts. Instead, fungal symbiont distributions will most likely track the range dynamics of host grasses.},

Differences in species compositional turnover among sites (β diversity) occurring along gradients are often used to infer variation in the processes structuring communities. Here, we show that sampling alone predicts changes in β diversity caused simply by changes in the sizes of species pools. For example, forest inventories sampled along latitudinal and elevational gradients show the well-documented pattern that β diversity is higher in the tropics and at low elevations. However, after correcting for variation in pooled species richness (γ diversity), these differences in β diversity disappear. Therefore, there is no need to invoke differences in the mechanisms of community assembly in temperate versus tropical systems to explain these global-scale patterns of β diversity.},

  abstract = {We present a new multivariate technique for testing the significance of individual terms in a multifactorial analysis-of-variance model for multispecies response variables. The technique will allow researchers to base analyses on measures of association (distance measures) that are ecologically relevant. In addition, unlike other distance-based hypothesis-testing techniques, this method allows tests of significance of interaction terms in a linear model. The technique uses the existing method of redundancy analysis (RDA) but allows the analysis to be based on Bray-Curtis or other ecologically meaningful measures through the use of principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Steps in the procedure include: (1) calculating a matrix of distances among replicates using a distance measure of choice (e.g., Bray-Curtis); (2) determining the principal coordinates (including a correction for negative eigenvalues, if necessary), which preserve these distances; (3) creating a matrix of dummy variables corresponding to the design of the experiment (i.e., individual terms in a linear model); (4) analyzing the relationship between the principal coordinates (species data) and the dummy variables (model) using RDA; and (5) implementing a test by permutation for particular statistics corresponding to the particular terms in the model. This method has certain advantages not shared by other multivariate testing procedures. We demonstrate the use of this technique with experimental ecological data from intertidal assemblages and show how the presence of significant multivariate interactions can be interpreted. It is our view that distance-based RDA will be extremely useful to ecologists measuring multispecies responses to structured multifactorial experimental designs.},

  abstract = {Summary 1. Tests of significance of the individual canonical axes in redundancy analysis allow researchers to determine which of the axes represent variation that can be distinguished from random. Variation along the significant axes can be mapped, used to draw biplots or interpreted through subsequent analyses, whilst the nonsignificant axes may be dropped from further consideration. 2. Three methods have been implemented in computer programs to test the significance of the canonical axes; they are compared in this paper. The simultaneous test of all individual canonical axes, which is appealing because of its simplicity, produced incorrect (highly inflated) levels of type I error for the axes following those corresponding to true relationships in the data, so it is invalid. The ‘marginal’ testing method implemented in the ‘vegan’ R package and the ‘forward’ testing method implemented in the program CANOCO were found to have correct levels of type I error and comparable power. Permutation of the residuals achieved greater power than permutation of the raw data. 3. R functions found in a Supplement to this paper provide the first formal description of the ‘marginal’ and ‘forward’ testing methods.},

  abstract = {Abstract Background Current solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) beads technology is widely used in molecular biology due to its convenience for DNA manipulation. However, the high performance commercial SPRI beads have no price advantage over our method. Furthermore, the use of commercially available SPRI beads standards does not provide the flexibility required for a number of specific nucleic acid handling scenarios. Results We report an efficient DNA purification strategy by combining home-made beads-suspension buffer with SPRI beads. The method tests the critical concentrations of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 and beads to maximise recovery. And the composition of the SPRI beads DNA purification system (SDPS) was determined at 20\% PEG 8000, 2\,M NaCl and 16.3\,mM MgCl 2 , and 1.25\,mg/ml beads (1/8th original concentration). Then, we tested the DNA recovery of the SDPS, and the result showed that it was comparable to the control (AMPure XP beads). In the study, we have also developed an adjustment SPRI beads DNA purification system (ASDPS), the volume of ASDPS per reaction is 0.6× reaction volume (beads/samples). The performance of ASDPS is similar to SDPS and the control. But the cost of our methods is only about 1/24th of the control. To further assess its performance, we prepare the DNA-seq libraries to evaluate the yield, library quality, capture efficiency and consistency. We have compared all these results with the performance of the control and confirmed its efficiency. Conclusion We have proposed an alternative DNA purification approach with great flexibility, allowing researchers to manipulate DNA in different conditions. And ultimately, its application will benefit molecular biology research in the future.},

Although molecular and adaptive breeding strategies can buffer the effects of climatic stress and improve crop resilience               5               , these approaches require sufficient knowledge of the genes that underlie productivity and adaptation               6               —knowledge that has been limited to a small number of well-studied model systems. Here we present the assembly and annotation of the large and complex genome of the polyploid bioenergy crop switchgrass (               Panicum virgatum               ). Analysis of biomass and survival among 732~resequenced genotypes, which were grown across 10~common gardens that span 1,800~km of latitude, jointly revealed extensive genomic evidence of climate adaptation. Climate–gene–biomass associations were abundant but varied considerably among deeply diverged gene pools. Furthermore, we found that gene flow accelerated climate adaptation during the postglacial colonization of northern habitats through introgression of alleles from a pre-adapted northern gene pool. The polyploid nature of switchgrass also enhanced adaptive potential through the fractionation of gene function, as there was an increased level of heritable genetic diversity on the nondominant subgenome. In addition to investigating patterns of climate adaptation, the genome resources and gene–trait associations developed here provide breeders with the necessary tools to increase switchgrass yield for the sustainable production of bioenergy.},

However, the high microbial densities detected on plant tissues, together with the fast generation time of microbes and their more ancient origin compared to their host, suggest that microbe-microbe interactions are also important selective forces sculpting complex microbial assemblages in the phyllosphere, rhizosphere, and plant endosphere compartments. Reductionist approaches conducted under laboratory conditions have been critical to decipher the strategies used by specific microbes to cooperate and compete within or outside plant tissues. Nonetheless, our understanding of these microbial interactions in shaping more complex plant-associated microbial communities, along with their relevance for host health in a more natural context, remains sparse. Using examples obtained from reductionist and community-level approaches, we discuss the fundamental role of microbe-microbe interactions (prokaryotes and micro-eukaryotes) for microbial community structure and plant health. We provide a conceptual framework illustrating that interactions among microbiota members are critical for the establishment and the maintenance of host-microbial homeostasis.},

In particular, plants and their associated communities have developed complex adaptation strategies against cold stress. Although changes in plant-associated microbial community structure have been analysed in different cold regions, scarce information is available on possible common taxonomic and functional features of microbial communities across cold environments. In this review, we discuss recent advances in taxonomic and functional characterization of plant-associated microbial communities in three main cold regions, such as alpine, Arctic and Antarctica environments. Culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches are analysed, in order to highlight the main factors affecting the taxonomic structure of plant-associated communities in cold environments. Moreover, biotechnological applications of plant-associated microorganisms from cold environments are proposed for agriculture, industry and medicine, according to biological functions and cold adaptation strategies of bacteria and fungi. Although further functional studies may improve our knowledge, the existing literature suggest that plants growing in cold environments harbor complex, host-specific and cold-adapted microbial communities, which may play key functional roles in plant growth and survival under cold conditions.},

Likewise, one of the central modern paradigms of plant ecophysiology, the leaf economics spectrum (LES), has been extensively studied in the context of these factors across ecological scales ranging from global species data sets to temporal shifts within individuals. Despite strong physiological links between LES strategy and leaf defenses in structure, function, and resource investment, the relationship between these trait classes has not been well explored. This study investigates the relationship between leaf defenses and LES strategy across whole-plant ontogeny in three diverse Helianthus species known to exhibit dramatic ontogenetic shifts in LES strategy, focusing primarily on physical and quantitative chemical defenses. Plants were grown under controlled environmental conditions and sampled for LES and defense traits at four ontogenetic stages. Defenses were found to shift strongly with ontogeny, and to correlate strongly with LES strategy. More advanced ontogenetic stages with more conservative LES strategy leaves had higher tannin activity and toughness in all species, and higher leaf dry matter content in two of three species. Modeling results in two species support the conclusion that changes in defenses drive changes in LES strategy through ontogeny, and in one species that changes in defenses and LES strategy are likely independently driven by ontogeny. Results of this study support the hypothesis that leaf-level allocation to defenses might be an important determinant of leaf economic traits, where high investment in defenses drives a conservative LES strategy.},

Meadow fescue (Festuca pratensis) is a cool-season grass known for its symbiotic relationship with the systemic and vertically—via seeds—transmitted fungal endophyte Epichloë uncinata, yet its effects on plant hormones and the microbial community is largely unexplored. Here, we sequenced the endophytic bacterial and fungal communities in the leaves and roots, analyzing phytohormone concentrations and plant performance parameters in Epichloë-symbiotic (E+) and Epichloë-free (E-) individuals of two meadow fescue cultivars. The endophytic microbial community differed between leaf and root tissues independent of Epichloë symbiosis, while the fungal community was different in the leaves of Epichloë-symbiotic and Epichloë-free plants in both cultivars. At the same time, Epichloë symbiosis decreased salicylic acid and increased auxin concentrations in leaves. Epichloë-symbiotic plants showed higher biomass and higher seed mass at the end of the season. Our results demonstrate that Epichloë symbiosis alters the leaf fungal microbiota, which coincides with changes in phytohormone concentrations, indicating that Epichloë endophytes affect both plant immune responses and other fungal endophytes. Whether the effect of Epichloë endophytes on other fungal endophytes is connected to changes in phytohormone concentrations remains to be elucidated.},

Previous nonparametric methods have succeeded in one or other of these areas, but not in both. A recent contribution to Ecological Monographs by Legendre and Anderson, called distance-based redundancy analysis (db-RDA), does achieve both. It does this by calculating principal coordinates and subsequently correcting for negative eigenvalues, if they are present, by adding a constant to squared distances. We show here that such a correction is not necessary. Partitioning can be achieved directly from the distance matrix itself, with no corrections and no eigenanalysis, even if the distance measure used is semimetric. An ecological example is given to show the differences in these statistical methods. Empirical simulations, based on parameters estimated from real ecological species abundance data, showed that db-RDA done on multifactorial designs (using the correction) does not have type 1 error consistent with the significance level chosen for the analysis (i.e., does not provide an exact test), whereas the direct method described and advocated here does.},

  abstract = {Fungal endophytes isolated from healthy Theobroma cacao tissues were screened in vitro for antagonism against major pathogens of cacao. Of tested endophytic morphospecies, 40\% (21/52), 65\% (28/43) and 27\% percent (4/15) showed in vitro antagonism against Moniliophthora roreri (frosty pod rot), Phytophthora palmivora (black pod rot) and Moniliophthora perniciosa (witches broom), respectively. The most common antagonistic mechanism was simple competition for substrate. Nonetheless, 13\%, 21\%, and 0\% of tested morphospecies showed clear antibiosis against M. roreri, P. palmivora, and M. perniciosa, respectively. One isolate of Trichoderma was observed to be parasitic on M. roreri. Endophyte species that were common in the host plants under natural conditions often are good colonizers and grow fast in vitro whereas antibiosis producers usually appear to be relatively rare in nature, tend to grow slowly in vitro, and often are not good colonizers. We suggest that there is an inherent general trade-off between fast growth (high colonization) and production of chemicals that produce antibiosis reactions. Finally, field trials assessing the effects of three endophytic fungi (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Clonostachys rosea and Botryosphaeria ribis) on pod loss due to M. roreri and Phytophthora spp. were conducted at four farms in Panama. Although the overall incidence of black pod rot was very low during the tests, treatment with C. gloeosporioides significantly decreased pod loss due to that disease. We observed no decrease in pod loss due to frosty pod rot, but treatment with C. rosea reduced the incidence of cacao pods with sporulating lesions of M. roreri by 10\%. The observed reduction in pod loss due to Phytophthora spp., and sporulation by M. roreri, supports the potential of fungal endophytes as biological control agents. Further, these studies suggest that combined information from field censuses of endophytic fungi, in vitro studies, and greenhouse experiments can provide useful a priori criteria for identifying desirable attributes for potential biocontrol agents. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {It is increasingly recognized that macro-organisms (corals, insects, plants, vertebrates) consist of both host tissues and multiple microbial symbionts that play essential roles in their host's ecological and evolutionary success. Consequently, identifying benefits and costs of symbioses, as well as mechanisms underlying them are research priorities. All plants surveyed under natural conditions harbor foliar endophytic fungi (FEF) in their leaf tissues, often at high densities. Despite producing no visible effects on their hosts, experiments have nonetheless shown that FEF reduce pathogen and herbivore damage. Here, combining results from three genomic, and two physiological experiments, we demonstrate pervasive genetic and phenotypic effects of the apparently asymptomatic endophytes on their hosts. Specifically, inoculation of endophyte-free (E-) Theobroma cacao leaves with Colletotrichum tropicale (E+), the dominant FEF species in healthy T. cacao, induces consistent changes in the expression of hundreds of host genes, including many with known defensive functions. Further, E+ plants exhibited increased lignin and cellulose content, reduced maximum rates of photosynthesis (Amax), and enrichment of nitrogen-15 and carbon-13 isotopes. These phenotypic changes observed in E+ plants correspond to changes in expression of specific functional genes in related pathways. Moreover, a cacao gene (Tc00g04254) highly up-regulated by C. tropicale also confers resistance to pathogen damage in the absence of endophytes or their products in host tissues. Thus, the benefits of increased pathogen resistance in E+ plants are derived in part from up-regulation of intrinsic host defense responses, and appear to be offset by potential costs including reduced photosynthesis, altered host nitrogen metabolism, and endophyte heterotrophy of host tissues. Similar effects are likely in most plant-endophyte interactions, and should be recognized in the design and interpretation of genetic and phenotypic studies of plants.},

  abstract = {When addressing the nature of ecological adaptation and environmental factors limiting population ranges and contributing to speciation, it is important to consider not only the plant's genotype and its response to the environment, but also any close interactions that it has with other organisms, specifically, symbiotic microorganisms. To investigate this, soils and seedlings were reciprocally transplanted into common gardens of the big sagebrush hybrid zone in Salt Creek Canyon, Utah, to determine location and edaphic effects on the fitness of parental and hybrid plants. Endophytic symbionts and functional microbial diversity of indigenous and transplanted soils and sagebrush plants were also examined. Strong selection occurred against the parental genotypes in the middle hybrid zone garden in middle hybrid zone soil; F               1               hybrids had the highest fitness under these conditions. Neither of the parental genotypes had superior fitness in their indigenous soils and habitats; rather F               1               hybrids with the nonindigenous maternal parent were superiorly fit. Significant garden‐by‐soil type interactions indicate adaptation of both plant and soil microorganisms to their indigenous soils and habitats, most notably in the middle hybrid zone garden in middle hybrid zone soil. Contrasting performances of F               1               hybrids suggest asymmetrical gene flow with mountain, rather than basin, big sagebrush acting as the maternal parent. We showed that the microbial community impacted the performance of parental and hybrid plants in different soils, likely limiting the ranges of the different genotypes.},

Recent experiments in lab-reared vertebrates have shown that changes in environmental temperature can induce shifts in the gut microbiota, and in some cases these shifts have been shown to affect host thermal physiology. However, there is a lack of information about the effects of temperature on the gut microbiota of wild-caught vertebrates. Moreover, in ectotherms, which are particularly vulnerable to changing temperature regimens, the extent to which microbiota composition is shaped by temperature and associated with host thermal tolerance has not been investigated. To address these issues, we monitored the gut microbiota composition of wild-caught western fence lizards (               Sceloporus occidentalis               ) experimentally exposed to a cool-to-warm temperature transition. Comparing experimentally exposed and control lizards indicated that warm temperatures altered and destabilized the composition of the               S. occidentalis               gut microbiota. Warming drove a significant reduction in the relative abundances of a clade of               Firmicutes               , a significant increase in the rate of compositional turnover in the gut microbiota within individual lizards, and increases in the abundances of bacteria from predicted pathogenic clades. In addition, the composition of the microbiota was significantly associated with the thermal tolerance of lizards measured at the end of the experiment. These results suggest that temperature can alter the lizard gut microbiota, with potential implications for the physiological performance and fitness of natural populations.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Why do populations remain genetically variable despite strong continuous natural selection? Mutation reconstitutes variation eliminated by selection and genetic drift, but theoretical and experimental studies each suggest that mutation‐selection balance insufficient to explain extant genetic variation in most complex traits. The alternative hypothesis of balancing selection, wherein selection maintains genetic variation, is an aggregate of multiple mechanisms (spatial and temporal heterogeneity in selection, frequency‐dependent selection, antagonistic pleiotropy, etc.). Most of these mechanisms have been demonstrated for Mendelian traits, but there is little comparable data for loci affecting quantitative characters. Here, we report a 3‐year field study of selection on intrapopulation quantitative trait loci (QTL) of flower size, a highly polygenic trait in               Mimulus guttatus               . The QTL exhibit antagonistic pleiotropy: alleles that increase flower size, reduce viability, but increase fecundity. The magnitude and direction of selection fluctuates yearly and on a spatial scale of metres. This study provides direct evidence of balancing selection mechanisms on QTL of an ecologically relevant trait.},

  abstract = {Evolution by natural selection occurs when the frequencies of genetic variants change because individuals differ in Darwinian fitness components such as survival or reproductive success. Differential fitness has been demonstrated in field studies of many organisms, but it remains unclear how well we can quantitatively predict allele frequency changes from fitness measurements. Here, we characterize natural selection on millions of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome of the annual plant               Mimulus guttatus               . We use fitness estimates to calibrate population genetic models that effectively predict allele frequency changes into the next generation. Hundreds of SNPs experienced “male selection” in 2013 with one allele at each SNP elevated in frequency among successful male gametes relative to the entire population of adults. In the following generation, allele frequencies at these SNPs consistently shifted in the predicted direction. A second year of study revealed that SNPs had effects on both viability and reproductive success with pervasive trade-offs between fitness components. SNPs favored by male selection were, on average, detrimental to survival. These trade-offs (antagonistic pleiotropy and temporal fluctuations in fitness) may be essential to the long-term maintenance of alleles. Despite the challenges of measuring selection in the wild, the strong correlation between predicted and observed allele frequency changes suggests that population genetic models have a much greater role to play in forward-time prediction of evolutionary change.},

  abstract = {Angiosperm leaves manifest a remarkable diversity of shapes that range from developmental sequences within a shoot and within crown response to microenvironment to variation among species within and between communities and among orders or families. It is generally assumed that because photosynthetic leaves are critical to plant growth and survival, variation in their shape reflects natural selection operating on function. Several non-mutually exclusive theories have been proposed to explain leaf shape diversity. These include: thermoregulation of leaves especially in arid and hot environments, hydraulic constraints, patterns of leaf expansion in deciduous species, biomechanical constraints, adaptations to avoid herbivory, adaptations to optimise light interception and even that leaf shape variation is a response to selection on flower form. However, the relative importance, or likelihood, of each of these factors is unclear. Here we review the evolutionary context of leaf shape diversification, discuss the proximal mechanisms that generate the diversity in extant systems, and consider the evidence for each the above hypotheses in the context of the functional significance of leaf shape. The synthesis of these broad ranging areas helps to identify points of conceptual convergence for ongoing discussion and integrated directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Abstract Understanding how species-rich communities persist is a foundational question in ecology. In tropical forests, tree diversity is structured by edaphic factors, climate, and biotic interactions, with seasonality playing an essential role at landscape scales: wetter and less seasonal forests typically harbor higher tree diversity than more seasonal forests. We posited that the abiotic factors shaping tree diversity extend to hyperdiverse symbionts in leaves—fungal endophytes—that influence plant health, function, and resilience to stress. Through surveys in forests across Panama that considered climate, seasonality, and covarying biotic factors, we demonstrate that endophyte richness varies negatively with temperature seasonality. Endophyte community structure and taxonomic composition reflect both temperature seasonality and climate (mean annual temperature and precipitation). Overall our findings highlight the vital role of climate-related factors in shaping the hyperdiversity of these important and little-known symbionts of the trees that, in turn, form the foundations of tropical forest biodiversity.},

  abstract = {Consequences of shifting species distributions                            Climate change is causing geographical redistribution of plant and animal species globally. These distributional shifts are leading to new ecosystems and ecological communities, changes that will affect human society. Pecl               et al.               review these current and future impacts and assess their implications for sustainable development goals.                                         Science               , this issue p.               eaai9214                        ,                             BACKGROUND               The success of human societies depends intimately on the living components of natural and managed systems. Although the geographical range limits of species are dynamic and fluctuate over time, climate change is impelling a universal redistribution of life on Earth. For marine, freshwater, and terrestrial species alike, the first response to changing climate is often a shift in location, to stay within preferred environmental conditions. At the cooler extremes of their distributions, species are moving poleward, whereas range limits are contracting at the warmer range edge, where temperatures are no longer tolerable. On land, species are also moving to cooler, higher elevations; in the ocean, they are moving to colder water at greater depths. Because different species respond at different rates and to varying degrees, key interactions among species are often disrupted, and new interactions develop. These idiosyncrasies can result in novel biotic communities and rapid changes in ecosystem functioning, with pervasive and sometimes unexpected consequences that propagate through and affect both biological and human communities.                                         ADVANCES               At a time when the world is anticipating unprecedented increases in human population growth and demands, the ability of natural ecosystems to deliver ecosystem services is being challenged by the largest climate-driven global redistribution of species since the Last Glacial Maximum. We demonstrate the serious consequences of this species redistribution for economic development, livelihoods, food security, human health, and culture, and we document feedbacks on climate itself. As with other impacts of climate change, species range shifts will leave “winners” and “losers” in their wake, radically reshaping the pattern of human well-being between regions and different sectors and potentially leading to substantial conflict. The pervasive impacts of changes in species distribution transcend single systems or dimensions, with feedbacks and linkages between multiple interacting scales and through whole ecosystems, inclusive of humans. We argue that the negative effects of climate change cannot be adequately anticipated or prepared for unless species responses are explicitly included in decision-making and global strategic frameworks.                                         OUTLOOK               Despite mounting evidence for the pervasive and substantial impacts of a climate-driven redistribution of Earth’s species, current global goals, policies, and international agreements fail to account for these effects. With the predicted intensification of species movements and their diverse societal and environmental impacts, awareness of species “on the move” should be incorporated into local, regional, and global assessments as standard practice. This will raise hope that future targets—whether they be global sustainability goals, plans for regional biodiversity maintenance, or local fishing or forestry harvest strategies—can be achievable and that society is prepared for a world of universal ecological change. Human society has yet to appreciate the implications of unprecedented species redistribution for life on Earth, including for human lives. Even if greenhouse gas emissions stopped today, the responses required in human systems to adapt to the most serious effects of climate-driven species redistribution would be massive. Meeting these challenges requires governance that can anticipate and adapt to changing conditions, as well as minimize negative consequences.                                                   As the global climate changes, human well-being, ecosystem function, and even climate itself are increasingly affected by the shifting geography of life.                   Climate-driven changes in species distributions, or range shifts, affect human well-being both directly (for example, through emerging diseases and changes in food supply) and indirectly (by degrading ecosystem health). Some range shifts even create feedbacks (positive or negative) on the climate system, altering the pace of climate change.                                                                         ,              Distributions of Earth’s species are changing at accelerating rates, increasingly driven by human-mediated climate change. Such changes are already altering the composition of ecological communities, but beyond conservation of natural systems, how and why does this matter? We review evidence that climate-driven species redistribution at regional to global scales affects ecosystem functioning, human well-being, and the dynamics of climate change itself. Production of natural resources required for food security, patterns of disease transmission, and processes of carbon sequestration are all altered by changes in species distribution. Consideration of these effects of biodiversity redistribution is critical yet lacking in most mitigation and adaptation strategies, including the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Interactions with microbial symbionts have yielded great macroevolutionary innovations across the tree of life, like the origins of chloroplasts and the mitochondrial powerhouses of eukaryotic cells. There is also increasing evidence that host‐associated microbiomes influence patterns of microevolutionary adaptation in plants and animals. Here we describe how microbes can facilitate adaptation in plants and how to test for and differentiate between the two main mechanisms by which microbes can produce adaptive responses in higher organisms: microbe‐mediated local adaptation and microbe‐mediated adaptive plasticity. Microbe‐mediated local adaptation is when local plant genotypes have higher fitness than foreign genotypes because of a genotype‐specific affiliation with locally beneficial microbes. Microbe‐mediated adaptive plasticity occurs when local plant phenotypes, elicited by either the microbial community or the non‐microbial environment, have higher fitness than foreign phenotypes as a result of interactions with locally beneficial microbes. These microbial effects on adaptation can be difficult to differentiate from traditional modes of adaptation but may be prevalent. Ignoring microbial effects may lead to erroneous conclusions about the traits and mechanisms underlying adaptation, hindering management decisions in conservation, restoration, and agriculture.},

  abstract = {We compared the leaf traits and plant performance of 53 co-occurring tree species in a semi-evergreen tropical moist forest community. The species differed in all leaf traits analyzed: leaf life span varied 11-fold among species, specific leaf area 5-fold, mass-based nitrogen 3-fold, mass-based assimilation rate 13-fold, mass-based respiration rate 15-fold, stomatal conductance 8-fold, and photosynthetic water use efficiency 4-fold. Photosynthetic traits were strongly coordinated, and specific leaf area predicted mass-based rates of assimilation and respiration; leaf life span predicted many other leaf characteristics. Leaf traits were closely associated with growth, survival, and light requirement of the species. Leaf investment strategies varied on a continuum trading off short-term carbon gain against long-term leaf persistence that, in turn, is linked to variation in whole-plant growth and survival. Leaf traits were good predictors of plant performance, both in gaps and in the forest understory. High growth in gaps is promoted by cheap, short-lived, and physiologically active leaves. High survival in the forest understory is enhanced by the formation of long-lived well protected leaves that reduce biomass loss by herbivory, mechanical disturbance, or leaf turnover. Leaf traits underlay this growth–survival trade-off; species with short-lived, physiologically active leaves have high growth but low survival. This continuum in leaf traits, through its effect on plant performance, in turn gives rise to a continuum in species' light requirements.},

This increase in data size is a major challenge severely slowing down genomic analyses, leading to some software becoming obsolete and researchers having limited access to diverse analysis tools.                                         Results               Here we present two R packages, bigstatsr and bigsnpr, allowing for the analysis of large scale genomic data to be performed within R. To address large data size, the packages use memory-mapping for accessing data matrices stored on disk instead of in RAM. To perform data pre-processing and data analysis, the packages integrate most of the tools that are commonly used, either through transparent system calls to existing software, or through updated or improved implementation of existing methods. In particular, the packages implement fast and accurate computations of principal component analysis and association studies, functions to remove single nucleotide polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium and algorithms to learn polygenic risk scores on millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms. We illustrate applications of the two R packages by analyzing a case–control genomic dataset for celiac disease, performing an association study and computing polygenic risk scores. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of the R packages by analyzing a simulated genome-wide dataset including 500\,000 individuals and 1 million markers on a single desktop computer.

Predicting fungal symbiont distributions under future climates first requires knowledge of current distributions and their potential drivers. Location We documented colonization by fungal symbionts in perennial, cool-season grasses along altitudinal gradients in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, USA. Methods Across seven replicate altitudinal gradients, spanning c.1400 vertical meters, we scored fungal colonization for 46 grass species. We documented altitudinal clines in colonization by both above-ground and below-ground fungal symbionts for the first time, including localized foliar endophytes (LFE) and systemic endophytes (epichloae) in leaves and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSE) in roots. For a subset of 16 well-sampled grass species, we used model selection procedures to evaluate the relative importance of geography, edaphic factors and host plant identity. We also assessed the influence of host phylogenetic relatedness and colonization by co-infecting fungi. Results Levels of fungal colonization varied strongly with host plant identity, but the effects of particular host species were not consistent across fungal groups. In addition to the influence of host identity, epichloae colonization declined with elevation and varied with geography (latitude/longitude) and edaphic factors. Geography and collection date were important predictors of LFE colonization, with higher colonization later in the growing season. Colonization estimates for the obligately plant-associated fungi (epichloae, AMF) were phylogenetically conserved across the grass supertree. Positive correlations between AMF and DSE, which remained even after accounting for host plant relatedness, suggested possible synergisms between these fungal groups. Main conclusions Our survey showed greater host specificity in patterns of fungal colonization than prior reports and revealed that different fungal symbiont groups do not share similar drivers. Conserving plant–fungal symbioses under future climates may require unique strategies for different plant species and fungal symbiont types.},

Here, we evaluated the role of pollinator‐mediated dispersal on the contribution of neutral and selective processes in the assembly of floral microbiomes of the yellow monkeyflower (               Mimulus guttatus               ). We sampled floral organs from flowers in the presence and absence of pollinators within five different serpentine seeps in CA and obtained 16S amplicon data on the epiphytic bacterial communities. Consistent with strong microenvironment selection within flowers we observed significant differences in community composition across floral organs and only a small effect of geographic distance. Pollinator exposure affected the contribution of environmental selection and depended on the rate and intimacy of interactions with flower visitors. This study provides evidence of the importance of dispersal and within‐flower heterogeneity in shaping epiphytic bacterial communities of flowers, and highlights the complex interplay between pollinator behaviour, environmental selection and additional abiotic factors in shaping the epiphytic bacterial communities of flowers.},

Nonseptate hyphac and arbuscules occur in a specialized meristematic region of the cortex that continually provided new cells for fungal infection. Arbuscules are morphologically identical to those of living arbuscular mycorrhizae in consisting of a basal trunk and repeatedly branched bush-like tuft within the plant cell. Although interpretations of the evolution of mycorrhizal mutualisms continue to be speculative, the existence of arbuscules in the Early Devonian indicates that nutrient transfer mutualism may have been in existence when plants invaded the land.},

  abstract = {Interactions between leaf-cutting ants, their fungal symbiont (               Leucoagaricus               ) and the endophytic fungi within the vegetation they carry into their colonies are still poorly understood. If endophytes antagonistic to               Leucoagaricus               were found in plant material being carried by these ants, then this might indicate a potential mechanism for plants to defend themselves from leaf-cutter attack. In addition, it could offer possibilities for the management of these important Neotropical pests. Here, we show that, for               Atta sexdens rubropilosa               , there was a significantly greater incidence of               Trichoderma               species in the vegetation removed from the nests—and deposited around the entrances—than in that being transported into the nests. In a no-choice test,               Trichoderma-               infested rice was taken into the nest, with deleterious effects on both the fungal gardens and ant survival. The endophytic ability of selected strains of               Trichoderma               was also confirmed, following their inoculation and subsequent reisolation from seedlings of eucalyptus. These results indicate that endophytic fungi which pose a threat to ant fungal gardens through their antagonistic traits, such as               Trichoderma               , have the potential to act as bodyguards of their plant hosts and thus might be employed in a Trojan-horse strategy to mitigate the negative impact of leaf-cutting ants in both agriculture and silviculture in the Neotropics. We posit that the ants would detect and evict such ‘malign’ endophytes—artificially inoculated into vulnerable crops—during the quality-control process within the nest, and, moreover, that the foraging ants may then be deterred from further harvesting of ‘               Trichoderma               -enriched’ plants.},

For some crop plants, it has been proven that endophytic               B.~bassiana               , besides its entomopathogenic habit, can provide protection against plant pathogens or limit their damaging effects. However, for grapevine, limited knowledge is available on the influence of endophytic               B.~bassiana               on fungal pathogens and about the mechanisms underlying putative protection effects. This study assessed the protective potential of endophytic               B.~bassiana               against grapevine downy mildew               Plasmopara viticola               in greenhouse experiments. Three and seven days after a               B.~bassiana               treatment, potted grapevine plants were inoculated with               P.~viticola               and the evolving disease severity was assessed. Disease severity was significantly reduced in               B.~bassiana               ‐treated plants compared to control plants, depending on the age of leaves. Furthermore, a microarray and an RT‐qPCR analysis were performed to work out fundamental aspects of genes involved in the interaction between grapevine and               B.~bassiana               . The results indicate an up‐regulation of diverse defence‐related genes in grapevine as a response to endophytic establishment of               B.~bassiana               . Thus, endophytic establishment of an entomopathogenic fungus such as               B.~bassiana               in grapevine plants would represent an alternative and sustainable plant protection strategy, with the potential for reducing pesticide applications in viticulture.},

  abstract = {Background                                Allergic airway disease (AAD) is a growing concern in industrialized nations and can be influenced by fungal exposures. Basidiomycota yeast species such as                 Cryptococcus neoformans                 are known to exacerbate allergic airway disease; however, recent indoor assessments have identified other Basidiomycota yeasts, including                 Vishniacozyma victoriae                 (syn.                 Cryptococcus victoriae                 ), to be prevalent and potentially associated with asthma. Until now, the murine pulmonary immune response to repeated                 V. victoriae                 exposure was previously unexplored.                                                        Objective                                This study aimed to compare the immunological impact of repeated pulmonary exposure to                 Cryptococcus                 yeasts.                                                        Methods                                Mice were repeatedly exposed to an immunogenic dose of                 C. neoformans                 or                 V. victoriae via                 oropharyngeal aspiration. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lungs were collected to examine airway remodeling, inflammation, mucous production, cellular influx, and cytokine responses at 1 day and 21 days post final exposure. The responses to                 C. neoformans                 and                 V. victoriae                 were analyzed and compared.                                                        Results                                Following repeated exposure, both                 C. neoformans                 and                 V. victoriae                 cells were still detectable in the lungs 21 days post final exposure. Repeated                 C. neoformans                 exposure initiated myeloid and lymphoid cellular infiltration into the lung that worsened over time, as well as an IL-4 and IL-5 response compared to PBS-exposed controls. In contrast, repeated                 V. victoriae                 exposure induced a strong CD4                 +                 T cell-driven lymphoid response that started to resolve by 21 days post final exposure.                                                        Discussion                                C. neoformans                 remained in the lungs and exacerbated the pulmonary immune responses as expected following repeated exposure. The persistence of                 V. victoriae                 in the lung and strong lymphoid response following repeated exposure were unexpected given its lack of reported involvement in AAD. Given the abundance in indoor environments and industrial utilization of                 V. victoriae                 , these results highlight the importance to investigate the impact of frequently detected fungal organisms on the pulmonary response following inhalational exposure. Moreover, it is important to continue to address the knowledge gap involving Basidiomycota yeasts and their impact on AAD.},

Plant leaves usually contain high levels of carbohydrates and secondary metabolites that can impact DNA purity, affecting downstream applications. Several protocols and kits are available for HMW DNA extraction, but they usually require a high amount of input material and often lead to substantial DNA fragmentation, making sequencing suboptimal in terms of read length and data yield. We here describe a protocol for plant HMW DNA extraction from low input material (0.1 g) which is easy to follow and quick (2.5 h). This method successfully enabled us to extract HMW from four species from different families (Orchidaceae, Poaceae, Brassicaceae, Asteraceae). In the case of recalcitrant species, we show that an additional purification step is sufficient to deliver a clean DNA sample. We demonstrate the suitability of our protocol for long-read sequencing on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies PromethION ® platform, with and without the use of a short fragment depletion kit.},

  abstract = {Beta‐diversity has been repeatedly shown to decline with increasing elevation, but the causes of this pattern remain unclear, partly because they are confounded by coincident variation in alpha‐ and gamma‐diversity. We used 8795 forest vegetation‐plot records from the Czech National Phytosociological Database to compare the observed patterns of beta diversity to null‐model expectations (beta‐deviation) controlling for the effects of alpha‐ and gamma‐diversity. We tested whether β‐diversity patterns along a 1200 m elevation gradient exclusively depend on the effect of varying species pool size, or also on the variation of the magnitude of community assembly mechanisms determining the distribution of species across communities (e.g. environmental filtering, dispersal limitation). The null model we used is a novel extension of an existing null‐model designed for presence/absence data and was specifically designed to disrupt the effect of community assembly mechanisms, while retaining some key features of observed communities such as average species richness and species abundance distribution. Analyses were replicated in ten subregions with comparable elevation ranges. Beta‐diversity declined along the elevation gradient due to a decrease in gamma‐diversity, which was steeper than the decrease in alpha‐diversity. This pattern persisted after controlling for alpha‐ and gamma‐diversity variation, and the results were robust when different resampling schemes and diversity metrics were used. We conclude that in temperate forests the pattern of decreasing beta‐diversity with elevation does not exclusively depend on variation in species pool size, as has been hypothesized, but also on variation in community assembly mechanisms. The results were consistent across resampling schemes and diversity measures, thus supporting the use of vegetation‐plot databases for understanding patterns of beta‐diversity at the regional scale.},

We synthesize classical concepts and the recent literature on a wide range of aspects of leaf venation. We describe 10 major structural features that contribute to multiple key functions, and scale up to leaf and plant performance. We describe the development and plasticity of leaf venation and its adaptation across environments globally, and a new global data compilation indicating trends relating vein length per unit area to climate, growth form and habitat worldwide. We synthesize the evolution of vein traits in the major plant lineages throughout paleohistory, highlighting the multiple origins of individual traits.

  abstract = {The Janzen-Connell (JC) hypothesis provides a conceptual framework for explaining the maintenance of tree diversity in tropical forests. Its central tenet - that recruits experience high mortality near conspecifics and at high densities - assumes a degree of host specialization in interactions between plants and natural enemies. Studies confirming JC effects have focused primarily on spatial distributions of seedlings and saplings, leaving major knowledge gaps regarding the fate of seeds in soil and the specificity of the soilborne fungi that are their most important antagonists. Here we use a common garden experiment in a lowland tropical forest in Panama to show that communities of seed-infecting fungi are structured predominantly by plant species, with only minor influences of factors such as local soil type, forest characteristics, or time in soil (1- 12 months). Inoculation experiments confirmed that fungi affected seed viability and germination in a host-specific manner and that effects on seed viability preceded seedling emergence. Seeds are critical components of reproduction for tropical trees, and the factors influencing their persistence, survival, and germination shape the populations of seedlings and saplings on which current perspectives regarding forest dynamics are based. Together these findings bring seed dynamics to light in the context of the JC hypothesis, implicating them directly in the processes that have emerged as critical for diversity maintenance in species-rich tropical forests.},

  abstract = {Abstract             All plants, including crop species, harbor a community of fungal endophyte species, yet we know little about the biotic factors that are important in endophyte community assembly. We suggest that the most direct route to understanding the mechanisms underlying community assembly is through the study of functional trait variation in the host and its fungal consortium. We review studies on crop endophytes that investigate plant and fungal traits likely to be important in endophyte community processes. We focus on approaches that could speed detection of general trends in endophyte community assembly: (i) use of the ‘assembly rules’ concept to identify specific mechanisms that influence endophyte community dynamics, (ii) measurement of functional trait variation in plants and fungi to better understand endophyte community processes and plant–fungal interactions, and (iii) investigation of microbe–microbe interactions, and fungal traits that mediate them. This approach is well suited for research in agricultural systems, where pair‐wise host–fungus interactions and mechanisms of fungal–fungal competition have frequently been described. Areas for consideration include the possibility that human manipulation of crop phenotype and deployment of fungal biocontrol species can significantly influence endophyte community assembly. Evaluation of endophyte assembly rules may help to fine‐tune crop management strategies.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                                           Considering it is common to find as much as 100-fold variation in the number of 16S rRNA gene sequences across samples in a study, researchers need to control for the effect of uneven sequencing effort. How to do this has become a contentious question. Some have argued that rarefying or rarefaction is “inadmissible” because it omits valid data. A number of alternative approaches have been developed to normalize and rescale the data that purport to be invariant to the number of observations. I generated community distributions based on 12 published data sets where I was able to assess the ability of multiple methods to control for uneven sequencing effort. Rarefaction was the only method that could control for variation in uneven sequencing effort when measuring commonly used alpha and beta diversity metrics. Next, I compared the false detection rate and power to detect true differences between simulated communities with a known effect size using various alpha and beta diversity metrics. Although all methods of controlling for uneven sequencing effort had an acceptable false detection rate when samples were randomly assigned to two treatment groups, rarefaction was consistently able to control for differences in sequencing effort when sequencing depth was confounded with treatment group. Finally, the statistical power to detect differences in alpha and beta diversity metrics was consistently the highest when using rarefaction. These simulations underscore the importance of using rarefaction to normalize the number of sequences across samples in amplicon sequencing analyses.                                         IMPORTANCE               Sequencing 16S rRNA gene fragments has become a fundamental tool for understanding the diversity of microbial communities and the factors that affect their diversity. Due to technical challenges, it is common to observe wide variation in the number of sequences that are collected from different samples within the same study. However, the diversity metrics used by microbial ecologists are sensitive to differences in sequencing effort. Therefore, tools are needed to control for the uneven levels of sequencing. This simulation-based analysis shows that despite a longstanding controversy, rarefaction is the most robust approach to control for uneven sequencing effort. The controversy started because of confusion over the definition of rarefaction and violation of assumptions that are made by methods that have been borrowed from other fields. Microbial ecologists should use rarefaction.                        ,              Sequencing 16S rRNA gene fragments has become a fundamental tool for understanding the diversity of microbial communities and the factors that affect their diversity.

  abstract = {Studies of heat and mass exchange between leaves and their local environment are central to our understanding of plant‐atmosphere interactions. The transfer across aerodynamic leaf boundary layers is generally described by non‐dimensional expressions which reflect largely empirical adaptations of engineering models derived for flat plates. This paper reviews studies on leaves, and leaf models with varying degrees of abstraction, in free and forced convection. It discusses implecations of finding for leaf morphology as it affects – and is affected by – the local microclimate. Predictions of transfer from many leaves in plant communities are complicated by physical and physiological feedback mechanisms between leaves and their environment. Some common approaches, and the current challenge of integrating leaf‐atmosphere interactions into models of global relevance, are also briefly addressed.

A core is typically defined as the suite of members shared among microbial consortia from similar habitats, and is represented by the overlapping areas of circles in Venn diagrams, in which each circle contains the membership of the sample or habitats being compared. Ecological insight into core microbiomes can be enriched by 'omics approaches that assess gene expression, thereby extending the concept of the core beyond taxonomically defined membership to community function and behaviour. Parameters defined by traditional ecology theory, such as composition, phylogeny, persistence and connectivity, will also create a more complex portrait of the core microbiome and advance understanding of the role of key microorganisms and functions within and across ecosystems.},

  abstract = {Of the approximately 380 families of angiosperms, representatives of only 10 are known to form symbiotic associations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in root nodules. The morphologically based classification schemes proposed by taxonomists suggest that many of these 10 families of plants are only distantly related, engendering the hypothesis that the capacity to fix nitrogen evolved independently several, if not many, times. This has in turn influenced attitudes toward the likelihood of transferring genes responsible for symbiotic nitrogen fixation to crop species lacking this ability. Phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences for the chloroplast gene rbcL indicates, however, that representatives of all 10 families with nitrogen-fixing symbioses occur together, with several families lacking this association, in a single clade. This study therefore indicates that only one lineage of closely related taxa achieved the underlying genetic architecture necessary for symbiotic nitrogen fixation in root nodules.},

  abstract = {Epichloë fungal endophytes are broadly found in cool-season grasses. The symbiosis between these grasses and Epichloë may improve the abiotic and biotic resistance of the grass plant, but some Epichloë species produce alkaloids that are toxic for livestock. Therefore, it is important to understand the characteristics of the grass-Epichloë s symbiosis so that the beneficial aspects can be preserved and the toxic effects to livestock can be avoided. Since the 1990s, Chinese researchers have conducted a series of studies on grass-Epichloë symbiosis. In this review, we describe the current state of Epichloë endophyte research in Chinese native grasses. We found that more than 77 species of native grasses in China are associated with Epichloë endophytes. In addition, we review the effects of various Epichloë species on native grass responses to abiotic and biotic stress, phylogeny, and alkaloid production. We provide an overview of the study of Epichloë species on native grasses in China and directions for future research.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                        Organisms can adapt to environmental heterogeneity through two mechanisms: (1) expression of population genetic variation or (2) phenotypic plasticity. In this study we investigated whether patterns of variation in both trait means and phenotypic plasticity along elevational and latitudinal clines in a North American endemic plant,             Mimulus laciniatus             , were consistent with local adaptation. We grew inbred lines of             M. laciniatus             from across the species’ range in two common gardens varying in day length to measure mean and plastic trait expression in several traits previously shown to be involved in adaptation to             M. laciniatus’s             rocky outcrop microhabitat: flowering time, size-related traits, and leaf shape. We examined correlations between the mean phenotype and phenotypic plasticity, and tested for a relationship between trait variation and population elevation and latitude. We did not find a strong correlation between mean and plastic trait expression at the individual genotype level suggesting that they operate under independent genetic controls. We identified multiple traits that show patterns consistent with local adaptation to elevation: critical photoperiod, flowering time, flower size, mean leaf lobing, and leaf lobing plasticity. These trends occur along multiple geographically independent altitudinal clines indicating that selection is a more likely cause of this pattern than gene flow among nearby populations with similar trait values. We also found that population variation in mean leaf lobing is associated with latitude. Our results indicate that both having more highly lobed leaves and greater leaf shape plasticity may be adaptive at high elevation within             M. laciniatus.             Our data strongly suggest that traits known to be under divergent selection between             M. laciniatus             and close relative             Mimulus guttatus             are also under locally varying selection within             M. laciniatus             .},

We identify the interaction of temporal and spatial variation in selection and their role in either reinforcing or eroding divergence between two closely related               Mimulus               species. Using repeated reciprocal transplant experiments with advanced generation hybrids, we compare the strength of selection on quantitative traits involved in adaptation and reproductive isolation in               Mimulus guttatus               and               Mimulus laciniatus               between two years with dramatically different water availability               .               We found strong divergent habitat-mediated selection on traits in the direction of species differences during a drought in 2013, suggesting that spatially varying selection maintains species divergence. However, a relaxation in divergent selection on most traits in an unusually wet year (2019), including flowering time, which is involved in pre-zygotic isolation, suggests that temporal variation in selection may weaken species differences. Therefore, we find evidence that temporally and spatially varying selection may have opposing roles in mediating species boundaries. Given our changing climate, future growing seasons are expected to be more similar to the dry year, suggesting that in this system climate change may actually increase species divergence.},

  abstract = {Leaf traits of plants worldwide are classified according to the Leaf Economics Spectrum (LES), which links leaf functional traits to evolutionary life history strategies. As a continuum ranging from thicker, tough leaves that are low in nitrogen (N) to thinner, softer, leaves that are high in N, the LES brings together physical, chemical, and ecological traits. Fungal endophytes are common foliar symbionts that occur in healthy, living leaves, especially in tropical forests. Their community composition often differs among co-occurring host species in ways that cannot be explained by environmental conditions or host phylogenetic relationships. Here, we tested the over-arching hypothesis that LES traits act as habitat filters that shape communities of endophytes both in terms of composition, and in terms of selecting for endophytes with particular suites of functional traits. We used culture-based and culture-free surveys to characterize foliar endophytes in mature leaves of 30 phylogenetically diverse plant species with divergent LES traits in lowland Panama, and then measured functional traits of dominant endophyte taxa in vitro . Endophytes were less abundant and less diverse in thick, tough, leaves compared to thin, softer, leaves in the same forest, even in closely related plants. Endophyte communities differed according to leaf traits, including leaf punch strength and carbon and nitrogen content. The most common endophyte taxa in leaves at different ends of the LES differ in their cellulase, protease, chitinase, and antipathogen activity. Our results extend the LES framework for the first time to diverse and ecologically important endophytes, opening new hypotheses regarding the degree to which foliar symbionts respond to, and extend, the functional traits of leaves they inhabit.},

We used CE-SSCP and 454 pyrosequencing to quantify the spatial variability of European beech phyllosphere fungal assemblages with a hierarchical sampling design including four different spatial scales (tree, branch, group of leaves and individual leaf). Fungal assemblages were highly diverse, with high proportions of generalist and cosmopolitan fungi. The major part of the variability was at the smallest spatial scale, between individual leaves. Within a single tree canopy, dissimilarity between fungal assemblages generally increased with distance between leaves. This pattern may be driven by within-canopy gradients of leaf traits and microclimate. At the stand scale, dissimilarity between fungal assemblages was correlated with the genetic distance rather than the geographic distance between trees, consistent with the findings of community genetics studies. Our results were constant over a small simulated sequencing depth, providing opportunities for the design of large-scale studies addressing the relationship between the genetic variation of trees and the variation of associated phyllosphere fungal assemblages.},

Here, we evaluate evidence for plastic and evolutionary responses to climate variation in amphibians and reptiles via a literature review and meta-analysis. We included studies that either document phenotypic changes through time or space. Plasticity had a clear and ubiquitous role in promoting phenotypic changes in response to climate variation. For adaptive evolution, we found no direct evidence for evolution of amphibians or reptiles in response to climate change over time. However, we found many studies that documented adaptive responses to climate along spatial gradients. Plasticity provided a mixture of adaptive and maladaptive responses to climate change, highlighting that plasticity frequently, but not always, could ameliorate climate change. Based on our review, we advocate for more experiments that survey genetic changes through time in response to climate change. Overall, plastic and genetic variation in amphibians and reptiles could buffer some of the formidable threats from climate change, but large uncertainties remain owing to limited data.},

We also sampled a replicated subset of genotypes across 3 additional sites to compare the importance of time, space, ecology, and genetics. We found a strong successional pattern in the microbiome shaped both by host genetics and environmental factors. Further, we used genome-wide association (GWA) mapping and RNA sequencing to show that 3 cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases (crRLKs) were linked to a genetic locus associated with microbiome structure. We confirmed GWAS results in an independent set of genotypes for both the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and large subunit (LSU) ribosomal DNA markers. Fungal pathogens were central to microbial covariance networks, and genotypes susceptible to pathogens differed in their expression of the 3 crRLKs, suggesting that host immune genes are a principal means of controlling the entire leaf microbiome.},

  abstract = {Tremellomycetes rDNA sequences previously detected in wheat kernels by MiSeq were not reliably assigned to a genus or clade. From comparisons of ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) and subsequent phylogenetic analyses, the following three basidiomycetous yeasts were resolved and identified: Vishniacozymavictoriae, V. tephrensis, and an undescribed Vishniacozyma rDNA variant. The Vishniacozyma variant’s clade is evolutionarily close to, but phylogenetically distinct from, the V. carnescens clade. These three yeasts were discovered in wheat kernel samples from the Canadian prairies. Variations in relative Vishniacozyma species abundances coincided with altered wheat kernel weight, as well as host resistance to chemibiotrophic Tilletia (Common bunt—CB) and necrotrophic Fusarium (Fusarium head blight—FHB) pathogens. Wheat kernel weight was influenced by the coexistence of Vishniacozyma with endophytic plant growth-promoting and mycoparasitic biocontrol fungi that were acquired by plants. Kernels were coated with beneficial Penicillium endophyte and Sphaerodes mycoparasite, each of which had different influences on the wild yeast population. Its integral role in the kernel microbiome renders Vishniacozyma a measurable indicator of the microbiome–plant interaction. The ability of NGS technology to detect specific endophytic DNA variants and early changes in dynamics among symbionts within the kernel ecological niche enables the prediction of crop disease emergence, suggesting that advanced microbiological testing may be a potentially useful tool for both phytoprotection and more efficient wheat breeding programs.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Green islands (the re-greening of senescent leaf tissues) are particularly evident on leaves infected with fungal pathogens. To date, there is only a limited number of studies investigating foliar endophytic microorganisms in phytopathogen-infected leaves. Here, we analysed bacterial and fungal endophyte communities in leaves without green islands (control leaves; CL), within green island areas (GLA) and the surrounding yellow leaf areas (YLA) of leaves with green islands of               Acer campestre               and               A. platanoides               . GLA samples of               A. campestre               and               A. platanoides               were dominated by               Sawadaea polyfida               and               S. bicornis               , respectively, suggesting that these fungi might be responsible for the green islands. We detected a higher fungal richness and diversity in CL compared to GLA samples of               A. campestre               . Leaf status (CL, GLA, YLA) significantly altered the composition of fungal communities of               A. campestre               . This was related to differences in fungal community composition between YLA and GLA samples. Site was the main driver of bacterial communities, suggesting that bacterial and fungal endophytes are shaped by different factors. Overall, we observed               Acer               species-specific responses of endophyte communities towards the presence of green islands and/or leaf type, which might be attributed to several fungi and bacteria specifically associated with one               Acer               species.},

The spectrum runs from quick to slow return on investments of nutrients and dry mass in leaves, and operates largely independently of growth form, plant functional type or biome. Categories along the spectrum would, in general, describe leaf economic variation at the global scale better than plant functional types, because functional types overlap substantially in their leaf traits. Overall, modulation of leaf traits and trait relationships by climate is surprisingly modest, although some striking and significant patterns can be seen. Reliable quantification of the leaf economics spectrum and its interaction with climate will prove valuable for modelling nutrient fluxes and vegetation boundaries under changing land-use and climate.},

In this review, we discuss how auxin maxima form to define leaf primordium formation. We summarize recent progress in understanding of how spatial auxin signaling promotes leaf blade formation. Finally, we discuss how spatial auxin transport and signaling regulate the patterning of compound leaves and leaf serration.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Specifying, assessing, and selecting among candidate statistical models is fundamental to ecological research. Commonly used approaches to model selection are based on predictive scores and include information criteria such as Akaike's information criterion, and cross validation. Based on data splitting, cross validation is particularly versatile because it can be used even when it is not possible to derive a likelihood (e.g., many forms of machine learning) or count parameters precisely (e.g., mixed‐effects models). However, much of the literature on cross validation is technical and spread across statistical journals, making it difficult for ecological analysts to assess and choose among the wide range of options. Here we provide a comprehensive, accessible review that explains important—but often overlooked—technical aspects of cross validation for model selection, such as: bias correction, estimation uncertainty, choice of scores, and selection rules to mitigate overfitting. We synthesize the relevant statistical advances to make recommendations for the choice of cross‐validation technique and we present two ecological case studies to illustrate their application. In most instances, we recommend using exact or approximate leave‐one‐out cross validation to minimize bias, or otherwise               k               ‐fold with bias correction if               k               \,{$<$}\,10. To mitigate overfitting when using cross validation, we recommend calibrated selection via our recently introduced modified one‐standard‐error rule. We advocate for the use of predictive scores in model selection across a range of typical modeling goals, such as exploration, hypothesis testing, and prediction, provided that models are specified in accordance with the stated goal. We also emphasize, as others have done, that inference on parameter estimates is biased if preceded by model selection and instead requires a carefully specified single model or further technical adjustments.},

However, only recently has it been realized that this system also holds great promise for studying the developmental genetics and evo-devo of important plant traits that are not found in well-established model systems such as Arabidopsis. Here, I review recent progress in four different areas of plant research enabled by this new model, including transcriptional regulation of carotenoid biosynthesis, formation of periodic pigmentation patterns, developmental genetics of corolla tube formation and elaboration, and the molecular basis of floral trait divergence underlying pollinator shift. These examples suggest that Mimulus offers ample opportunities to make exciting discoveries in plant development and evolution.},
