    Foliar fungal endophytes are known to alter plant physiology but the
    mechanisms by which they do so remain poorly understood. We focused on how
    plant gene expression was altered by six fungal strains that generated
    “water-saver” and “water-spender” drought physiologies in a C4 grass,
    Panicum hallii. Water-saver physiologies have lower plant water loss,
    improved wilt resistance, and higher survival compared with water-spender
    strategies. We expected that fungi within each functional group would have
    similar effects on P. hallii, and this was largely true for plant physiology
    but not for plant gene expression. When we focused only on genes that were
    differentially expressed relative to fungus-free controls, we found
    surprisingly little overlap in plant differentially expressed genes or gene
    regulatory pathways across the fungal treatments, including within and
    between the water-saver and water-spender strategies. Nevertheless, using
    lasso regression, we identified a small subset of genes that predicted 39
    and 53% of the variation in plant wilt resistance and water loss,
    respectively. These results suggest that fungal effects on plant
    transcription may identify how they extend the plant phenotype, and the
    comparison across multiple fungi allows us to differentiate broadly
    fungal-responsive plant genes versus those plant genes that respond only to
    single fungal taxa. The genes identified here could be targeted for future
    study to understand their function and, ultimately, represent candidates for
    precision breeding efforts to increase plant drought tolerance.

    Abstract
                Massively parallel sequencing has revolutionized many areas of biology, but sequencing large amounts of DNA in many individuals is cost-prohibitive and unnecessary for many studies. Genomic complexity reduction techniques such as sequence capture and restriction enzyme-based methods enable the analysis of many more individuals per unit cost. Despite their utility, current complexity reduction methods have limitations, especially when large numbers of individuals are analyzed. Here we develop a much improved restriction site-associated DNA (RAD) sequencing protocol and a new method called Rapture (RAD capture). The new RAD protocol improves versatility by separating RAD tag isolation and sequencing library preparation into two distinct steps. This protocol also recovers more unique (nonclonal) RAD fragments, which improves both standard RAD and Rapture analysis. Rapture then uses an in-solution capture of chosen RAD tags to target sequencing reads to desired loci. Rapture combines the benefits of both RAD and sequence capture, i.e., very inexpensive and rapid library preparation for many individuals as well as high specificity in the number and location of genomic loci analyzed. Our results demonstrate that Rapture is a rapid and flexible technology capable of analyzing a very large number of individuals with minimal sequencing and library preparation cost. The methods presented here should improve the efficiency of genetic analysis for many aspects of agricultural, environmental, and biomedical science.

    PERMANOVA is a computer program for testing the simultaneous response of one
    or more variables to one or more factors in an ANOVA experimental design on
    the basis of any distance measure, using permutation methods. These notes
    for users assume knowledge of multi-factorial ANOVA, which has the same
    basic logic in multivariate as in univariate analysis, and an understanding
    of what it means to test a multivariate hypothesis. A more complete
    description of the method is given in Anderson (2001a) and McArdle &
    Anderson (2001). The program includes: choice of appropriate transformation
    and/or standardization of the data; choice of 19 distance (or dissimilarity)
    measures to use as the basis of the analysis; option to rank the distances
    in the distance matrix before the analysis; analysis and partitioning of the
    total sum of squares according to the full model, including appropriate
    treatment of factors that are fixed or random, crossed (orthogonal) or
    nested (hierarchical), and all interaction terms; correct calculation of an
    appropriate distance-based pseudo F-statistic for each term in the model,
    based on expected mean squares as in univariate ANOVA (Winer et al. 1991,
    Searle et al.1992); correct permutation procedures to obtain P-values for
    each term in the model, using the correct permutable units (Anderson & ter
    Braak 2003); choice of permutation method: raw data units or residuals under
    either a reduced or a full model (Anderson 2001b, Anderson & Legendre 1999,
    Anderson & Robinson 2001); correct P-values also obtained through Monte
    Carlo random draws from the asymptotic permutation distribution (Anderson &
    Robinson 2003); option to include one or more covariables (i.e., to perform
    ANCOVA or MANCOVA); pair-wise a posteriori comparisons of levels for single
    factors, including within individual levels of other factors in the case of
    significant interactions and the use of correct permutable units in each
    case.

    Abstract
                Understanding the origins and maintenance of host specificity, or why horizontally‐acquired symbionts associate with some hosts but not others, remains elusive. In this study, we explored whether patterns of host specificity in foliar fungal endophytes, a guild of highly diverse fungi that occur within the photosynthetic tissues of all major plant lineages, were related to characteristics of the plant community. We comprehensively sampled all plant host species within a single community and tested the relationship between plant abundance or plant evolutionary relatedness and metrics of endophyte host specificity. We quantified host specificity with methods that considered the total endophyte community per plant host (i.e., multivariate methods) along with species‐based methods (i.e., univariate metrics) that considered host specificity from the perspective of each endophyte. Univariate host specificity metrics quantified plant alpha‐diversity (structural specificity), plant beta‐diversity (beta‐specificity), and plant phylogenetic diversity (phylogenetic specificity) per endophyte. We standardized the effect sizes of univariate host specificity metrics to randomized distributions to avoid spurious correlations between host specificity metrics and endophyte abundance. We found that more abundant plant species harbored endophytes that occupied fewer plant species (higher structural specificity) and were consistently found in the same plant species across the landscape (higher beta‐specificity). There was no relationship between plant phylogenetic distance and endophyte community dissimilarity. We still found that endophyte community composition significantly varied among plant species, families, and major groups, supporting a plant identity effect. In particular, endophytes in angiosperm lineages associated with narrower phylogenetic breadths of plants (higher phylogenetic specificity) compared to endophytes within conifer and fern lineages. Overall, an effect of plant species abundance may help explain why horizontally‐transmitted endophytes vary geographically within host species ranges.

    Dimensionality reduction techniques are a key component of most microbiome
    studies, providing both the ability to tractably visualize complex
    microbiome datasets and the starting point for additional, more formal,
    statistical analyses. In this review, we discuss the motivation for applying
    dimensionality reduction techniques, the special characteristics of
    microbiome data such as sparsity and compositionality that make this
    difficult, the different categories of strategies that are available for
    dimensionality reduction, and examples from the literature of how they have
    been successfully applied (together with pitfalls to avoid). We conclude by
    describing the need for further development in the field, in particular
    combining the power of phylogenetic analysis with the ability to handle
    sparsity, compositionality, and non-normality, as well as discussing current
    techniques that should be applied more widely in future analyses.

    Every plant species examined to date harbors endophytic fungi within its
    asymptomatic aerial tissues, such that endophytes rep-resent a ubiquitous,
    yet cryptic, component of terrestrial plant communities. Fungal endophytes
    associated with leaves of woody angiosperms are especially diverse; yet,
    fundamental aspects of their interactions with hosts are unknown. In
    contrast to the relatively species-poor endophytes that are vertically
    transmitted and act as defensive mutualists of some temperate grasses, the
    diverse, horizontally transmitted endophytes of woody angio-sperms are
    thought to contribute little to host defense. Here, we document high
    diversity, spatial structure, and host affinity among foliar endophytes
    associated with a tropical tree (Theobroma cacao, Malvaceae) across lowland
    Panama. We then show that inoculation of endophyte-free leaves with
    endophytes isolated frequently from naturally infected, asymptomatic hosts
    signifi-cantly decreases both leaf necrosis and leaf mortality when T. cacao
    seedlings are challenged with a major pathogen (Phytophthora sp.). In
    contrast to reports of fungal inoculation inducing systemic defense, we
    found that protection was primarily localized to endophyte-infected tissues.
    Further, endophyte-mediated protec-tion was greater in mature leaves, which
    bear less intrinsic defense against fungal pathogens than do young leaves.
    In vitro studies suggest that host affinity is mediated by leaf chemistry,
    and that protection may be mediated by direct interactions of endophytes
    with foliar pathogens. Together, these data demonstrate the capacity of
    diverse, horizontally transmitted endophytes of woody angiosperms to play an
    important but previously unappreciated role in host defense.

    Drought strongly influences plant phenology, growth and mortality in
    tropical forests, thereby shaping plant performance, population dynamics and
    community structure (Bunker & Carson 2005, Condit
                  et al.
                  1995). Microbial symbionts of plants profoundly influence host water relations (Lösch & Gansert 2002), but are rarely considered in studies of tropical plant physiology. In particular, plant–fungus associations, which are ubiquitous in plant communities and especially common in tropical forests, play important and varied roles in plant water status. Fungal pathogens associated with roots, vascular tissue and foliage may interfere with water uptake and transport, increase rates of foliar transpiration, and induce xylem embolism and tissue death (Agrios 1997). In contrast, rhizosphere mutualists such as ecto- and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi may benefit hosts by increasing surface area for water uptake, enhancing stomatal regulation of water loss, and increasing root hydraulic conductivity (Auge 2001, Lösch & Gansert 2002).

    Summary
                  Plant biology is experiencing a renewed interest in the mechanistic underpinnings and evolution of phenotypic plasticity that calls for a re‐evaluation of how we analyse phenotypic responses to a rapidly changing climate. We suggest that dissecting plant plasticity in response to increasing temperature needs an approach that can represent plasticity over multiple environments, and considers both population‐level responses and the variation between genotypes in their response. Here, we outline how a random regression mixed model framework can be applied to plastic traits that show linear or nonlinear responses to temperature. Random regressions provide a powerful and efficient means of characterising plasticity and its variation. Although they have been used widely in other fields, they have only recently been implemented in plant evolutionary ecology. We outline their structure and provide an example tutorial of their implementation.

    Evolutionary adaptation can be rapid and potentially help species counter
    stressful conditions or realize ecological opportunities arising from
    climate change. The challenges are to understand when evolution will occur
    and to identify potential evolutionary winners as well as losers, such as
    species lacking adaptive capacity living near physiological limits.
    Evolutionary processes also need to be incorporated into management
    programmes designed to minimize biodiversity loss under rapid climate
    change. These challenges can be met through realistic models of evolutionary
    change linked to experimental data across a range of taxa.

    SUMMARY The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for
    controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has
    faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple
    significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected
    proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses — the false discovery rate. This
    error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is
    smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false
    discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential
    for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved
    to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a
    simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the
    new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with
    examples.

    This paper proposes a new way of using forward selection of explanatory
    variables in regression or canonical redundancy analysis. The classical
    forward selection method presents two problems: a highly inflated Type I
    error and an overestimation of the amount of explained variance. Correcting
    these problems will greatly improve the performance of this very useful
    method in ecological modeling. To prevent the first problem, we propose a
    two‐step procedure. First, a global test using all explanatory variables is
    carried out. If, and only if, the global test is significant, one can
    proceed with forward selection. To prevent overestimation of the explained
    variance, the forward selection has to be carried out with two stopping
    criteria: (1) the usual alpha significance level and (2) the adjusted
    coefficient of multiple determination (
                  
                    
                  
                  ) calculated using all explanatory variables. When forward selection identifies a variable that brings one or the other criterion over the fixed threshold, that variable is rejected, and the procedure is stopped. This improved method is validated by simulations involving univariate and multivariate response data. An ecological example is presented using data from the Bryce Canyon National Park, Utah, USA.

    The identity of plant host genetic factors controlling the composition of
    the plant microbiota and the extent to which plant genes affect associated
    microbial populations is currently unknown. Here, we use a candidate gene
    approach to investigate host effects on the phyllosphere community
    composition and abundance. To reduce the environmental factors that might
    mask genetic factors, the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana was used in a
    gnotobiotic system and inoculated with a reduced complexity synthetic
    bacterial community composed of seven strains representing the most abundant
    phyla in the phyllosphere. From a panel of 55 plant mutants with alterations
    in the surface structure, cell wall, defense signaling, secondary
    metabolism, and pathogen recognition, a small number of single host
    mutations displayed an altered microbiota composition and/or abundance. Host
    alleles that resulted in the strongest perturbation of the microbiota
    relative to the wild-type were lacs2 and pec1. These mutants affect cuticle
    formation and led to changes in community composition and an increased
    bacterial abundance relative to the wild-type plants, suggesting that
    different bacteria can benefit from a modified cuticle to different extents.
    Moreover, we identified ein2, which is involved in ethylene signaling, as a
    host factor modulating the community's composition. Finally, we found that
    different Arabidopsis accessions exhibited different communities, indicating
    that plant host genetic factors shape the associated microbiota, thus
    harboring significant potential for the identification of novel plant
    factors affecting the microbiota of the communities.

    A Synthetic Community Approach Reveals Plant Genotypes Affecting the

    Fungal communities associated with plants often decrease in similarity as
    the distance between sampling sites increases (i.e., they demonstrate
    distance decay). In the southwestern USA, forests occur in highlands
    separated from one another by warmer, drier biomes with plant and fungal
    communities that differ from those at higher elevations. These disjunct
    forests are broadly similar in climate to one another, offering an
    opportunity to examine drivers of distance decay in plant-associated fungi
    across multiple ecologically similar yet geographically disparate
    landscapes. We examined ectomycorrhizal and foliar endophytic fungi
    associated with a dominant forest tree (Pinus ponderosa) in forests across
    ca. 550 km of geographic distance from northwestern to southeastern Arizona
    (USA). Both guilds of fungi showed distance decay, but drivers differed for
    each: ectomycorrhizal fungi are constrained primarily by dispersal
    limitation, whereas foliar endophytes are constrained by specific
    environmental conditions. Most ectomycorrhizal fungi were found in only a
    single forested area, as were many endophytic fungi. Such regional-scale
    perspectives are needed for baseline estimates of fungal diversity
    associated with forest trees at a landscape scale, with attention to the
    sensitivity of different guilds of fungal symbionts to decreasing areas of
    suitable habitat, increasing disturbance, and related impacts of climate
    change.

    Plant root−microbe interactions influence plant productivity, health, and
    resistance to stress. Although there is evidence that plant species and even
    genotypes can alter soil microbial community structure, environmental
    conditions can potentially outweigh plant genetic effects. Here, we used a
    reciprocal transplant experiment to understand the contributions of the
    environment and the host plant to rhizosphere microbiome composition in
    locally adapted ecotypes of Mimulus guttatus (syn. Erythranthe guttata). Two
    genotypes of a coastal ecotype and two genotypes of an inland ecotype were
    planted at coastal and inland sites. After 3 months, we collected
    rhizosphere and bulk soil and assessed microbial communities by 16S rRNA
    gene sequencing. We found that local environment (coastal versus inland
    site) strongly influenced rhizosphere communities, at least in part due to
    distinct local microbial species pools. Host identity played a smaller role:
    at each site, the ecotypes exhibited remarkably similar composition of
    microbial communities at the class level, indicating that divergent M.
    guttatus ecotypes recruit phylogenetically similar rhizosphere communities,
    even in environments to which they are maladapted. Nevertheless, the two
    ecotypes significantly differed in community composition at both sites due,
    in part, to an exclusive set of taxa associated with each ecotype. They also
    differed in alpha diversity at the inland site. Although this indicates that
    locally adapted M. guttatus ecotypes are genetically diverged in factors
    shaping rhizosphere communities, our findings highlight the context-specific
    interactions between host identity and local environment that shape those
    communities.

    Although complex interactions between hosts and microbial associates are
    increasingly well documented, we still know little about how and why hosts
    shape microbial communities in nature. In addition, host genetic effects on
    microbial communities vary widely depending on the environment, obscuring
    conclusions about which microbes are impacted and which plant functions are
    important. We characterized the leaf microbiota of 200
                  Arabidopsis thaliana
                  genotypes in eight field experiments and detected consistent host effects on specific, broadly distributed microbial species (operational taxonomic unit [OTUs]). Host genetic effects disproportionately influenced central ecological hubs, with heritability of particular OTUs declining with their distance from the nearest hub within the microbial network. These host effects could reflect either OTUs preferentially associating with specific genotypes or differential microbial success within them. Host genetics associated with microbial hubs explained over 10% of the variation in lifetime seed production among host genotypes across sites and years. We successfully cultured one of these microbial hubs and demonstrated its growth-promoting effects on plants in sterile conditions. Finally, genome-wide association mapping identified many putatively causal genes with small effects on the relative abundance of microbial hubs across sites and years, and these genes were enriched for those involved in the synthesis of specialized metabolites, auxins, and the immune system. Using untargeted metabolomics, we corroborate the consistent association between variation in specialized metabolites and microbial hubs across field sites. Together, our results reveal that host genetic variation impacts the microbial communities in consistent ways across environments and that these effects contribute to fitness variation among host genotypes.

    Abstract
                Microorganisms are widely distributed in a multitude of environments including ecosystems that show challenging features to most life forms. The combination of extreme physical and chemical factors contributes to the definition of extreme habitats although the definition of extreme environments changes depending on one's point of view: anthropocentric, microbial‐centric or zymo‐centric. Microorganisms that live under conditions that cause hard survival are called extremophiles. In particular organisms that require extreme conditions are called true extremophiles while organisms that tolerate them to some extent are termed extremotolerant. Deviation of temperature, pH, osmotic stress, pressure and radiation from the common range delineates extreme environments. Yeasts are versatile eukaryotic organisms that are not frequently considered the toughest microorganisms in comparison with prokaryotes. Nevertheless extremophilic or extremotolerant species are present also within this group. Here a brief description is provided of the main extreme habitats and the metabolic and physiological modifications adopted by yeasts depending on their adverse conditions. Additionally the main extremophilic and extremotolerant yeast species associated with a few extreme habitats are listed.

    Hill numbers or the effective number of species are increasingly used to
    quantify species diversity of an assemblage. Hill numbers were recently
    extended to phylogenetic diversity, which incorporates species evolutionary
    history, as well as to functional diversity, which considers the differences
    among species traits. We review these extensions and integrate them into a
    framework of attribute diversity (the effective number of entities or total
    attribute value) based on Hill numbers of taxonomic entities (species),
    phylogenetic entities (branches of unit-length), or functional entities
    (species-pairs with unit-distance between species). This framework unifies
    ecologists' measures of species diversity, phylogenetic diversity, and
    distance-based functional diversity. It also provides a unified method of
    decomposing these diversities and constructing normalized taxonomic,
    phylogenetic, and functional similarity and differentiation measures,
    including N-assemblage phylogenetic or functional generalizations of the
    classic Jaccard, Sørensen, Horn, and Morisita-Horn indexes. A real example
    shows how this framework extracts ecological meaning from complex data.

    Quantifying and assessing changes in biological diversity are central
    aspects of many ecological studies, yet accurate methods of estimating
    biological diversity from sampling data have been elusive. Hill numbers, or
    the effective number of species, are increasingly used to characterize the
    taxonomic, phylogenetic, or functional diversity of an assemblage. However,
    empirical estimates of Hill numbers, including species richness, tend to be
    an increasing function of sampling effort and, thus, tend to increase with
    sample completeness. Integrated curves based on sampling theory that
    smoothly link rarefaction (interpolation) and prediction (extrapolation)
    standardize samples on the basis of sample size or sample completeness and
    facilitate the comparison of biodiversity data. Here we extended previous
    rarefaction and extrapolation models for species richness (Hill number
                  
                    q
                    D
                  
                  , where
                  q
                  = 0) to measures of taxon diversity incorporating relative abundance (i.e., for any Hill number
                  
                    q
                    D
                  
                  ,
                  q
                  > 0) and present a unified approach for both individual‐based (abundance) data and sample‐based (incidence) data. Using this unified sampling framework, we derive both theoretical formulas and analytic estimators for seamless rarefaction and extrapolation based on Hill numbers. Detailed examples are provided for the first three Hill numbers:
                  q
                  = 0 (species richness),
                  q
                  = 1 (the exponential of Shannon's entropy index), and
                  q
                  = 2 (the inverse of Simpson's concentration index). We developed a bootstrap method for constructing confidence intervals around Hill numbers, facilitating the comparison of multiple assemblages of both rarefied and extrapolated samples. The proposed estimators are accurate for both rarefaction and short‐range extrapolation. For long‐range extrapolation, the performance of the estimators depends on both the value of
                  q
                  and on the extrapolation range. We tested our methods on simulated data generated from species abundance models and on data from large species inventories. We also illustrate the formulas and estimators using empirical data sets from biodiversity surveys of temperate forest spiders and tropical ants.

    Background 

    The different hypotheses proposed to explain positive species
    richness–productivity relationships, i.e. selection effect and
    complementarity effect, imply that plant functional characteristics are at
    the core of a mechanistic understanding of biodiversity effects.



    Methodology/Principal Findings 

    We used two community-wide measures of plant functional composition, (1)
    community-weighted means of trait values (CWM) and (2) functional trait
    diversity based on Rao’s quadratic diversity (FDQ) to predict biomass
    production and measures of biodiversity effects in experimental grasslands
    (Jena Experiment) with different species richness (2, 4, 8, 16 and 60) and
    different functional group number and composition (1 to 4; legumes, grasses,
    small herbs, tall herbs) four years after establishment. Functional trait
    composition had a larger predictive power for community biomass and measures
    of biodiversitity effects (40–82% of explained variation) than species
    richness per se (<1–13% of explained variation). CWM explained a larger
    amount of variation in community biomass (80%) and net biodiversity effects
    (70%) than FDQ (36 and 38% of explained variation respectively). FDQ
    explained similar proportions of variation in complementarity effects (24%,
    positive relationship) and selection effects (28%, negative relationship) as
    CWM (27% of explained variation for both complementarity and selection
    effects), but for all response variables the combination of CWM and FDQ led
    to significant model improvement compared to a separate consideration of
    different components of functional trait composition. Effects of FDQ were
    mainly attributable to diversity in nutrient acquisition and life-history
    strategies. The large spectrum of traits contributing to positive effects of
    CWM on biomass production and net biodiversity effects indicated that
    effects of dominant species were associated with different trait
    combinations.



    Conclusions/Significance 

    Our results suggest that the identification of relevant traits and the
    relative impacts of functional identity of dominant species and functional
    diversity are essential for a mechanistic understanding of the role of plant
    diversity for ecosystem processes such as aboveground biomass production.

    Abstract
                
                  The interaction between two species often depends on the presence or absence of a third species. One widespread three‐species interaction involves fungal endophytes infecting grasses and the herbivores that feed upon them. The endophytes are allied with the fungal family Clavicipitaceae and grow systemically in intercellular spaces in above‐ground plant tissues including seeds. Like related
                  Claviceps
                  species, the endophytes produce a variety of alkaloids that make the host plants toxic or distasteful to herbivores. A large number of grass species are infected, especially cool‐season grasses in temperate areas. Field and laboratory studies have shown that herbivores avoid infected plants in choice trials and suffer increased mortality and decreased growth on infected grasses in feeding experiments. Resistance to herbivores may provide a selective advantage to infected plants in competitive interactions with noninfected plants. Recent studies have shown that differential herbivory can reverse competitive hierarchies among plant species. Both endophyte‐infected and noninfected tall fescue grass (
                  Festuca arundinacea
                  ) are outcompeted by orchardgrass (
                  Dactylis glomerata
                  ) in the absence of insect herbivory. However, when herbivores are present infected tall fescue outcompetes orchardgrass. These results suggest that the frequency of infection in grass species and grassland communities will increase over time. Several studies are reviewed illustrating increases in infection frequency within grass populations subject to herbivore pressure. Endophytic fungi may be important regulators of plant‐herbivore interactions and so indirectly affect the structure and dynamics of plant communities.

    The diversity of fungi along environmental gradients has been little
    explored in contrast to plants and animals. Consequently, environmental
    factors influencing the composition of fungal assemblages are poorly
    understood. The aim of this study was to determine whether the diversity and
    composition of leaf and root-associated fungal assemblages vary with
    elevation and to investigate potential explanatory variables.
    High-throughput sequencing of the Internal Transcribed Spacer 1 region was
    used to explore fungal assemblages along three elevation gradients, located
    in French mountainous regions. Beech forest was selected as a study system
    to minimise the host effect. The variation in species richness and specific
    composition was investigated for ascomycetes and basidiomycetes assemblages
    with a particular focus on root-associated ectomycorrhizal fungi. The
    richness of fungal communities associated with leaves or roots did not
    significantly relate to any of the tested environmental drivers, i.e.
    elevation, mean temperature, precipitation or edaphic variables such as soil
    pH or the ratio carbon∶nitrogen. Nevertheless, the ascomycete species
    richness peaked at mid-temperature, illustrating a mid-domain effect model.
    We found that leaf and root-associated fungal assemblages did not follow
    similar patterns of composition with elevation. While the composition of the
    leaf-associated fungal assemblage correlated primarily with the mean annual
    temperature, the composition of root-associated fungal assemblage was
    explained equally by soil pH and by temperature. The ectomycorrhizal
    composition was also related to these variables. Our results therefore
    suggest that above and below-ground fungal assemblages are not controlled by
    the same main environmental variables. This may be due to the larger
    amplitude of climatic variables in the tree foliage compared to the soil
    environment.

    Summary

    Little is known about the potential effect of climate warming on
    phyllosphere fungi, despite their important impact on the dynamics and
    diversity of plant communities. The structure of phyllosphere fungal
    assemblages along elevation gradients may provide information about this
    potential effect, because elevation gradients correspond to temperature
    gradients over short geographic distances.

    We thus investigated variations in the composition of fungal assemblages
    inhabiting the phyllosphere of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) at four
    sites over a gradient of 1000m of elevation in the French Pyrenees
    Mountains, by using tag-encoded 454 pyrosequencing.

    Our results show that the composition of fungal assemblages varied
    significantly between elevation sites, in terms of both the relative
    abundance and the presence–absence of species, and that the variations in
    assemblage composition were well correlated with variations in the average
    temperatures.

    Our results therefore suggest that climate warming might alter both the
    incidence and the abundance of phyllosphere fungal species, including
    potential pathogens. For example, Mycosphaerella punctiformis, a causal
    agent of leaf spots, showed decreasing abundance with elevation and might
    therefore shift to higher elevations in response to warming.

    Microorganisms colonizing plant surfaces and internal tissues provide a
    number of life-support functions for their host. Despite increasing
    recognition of the vast functional capabilities of the plant microbiome, our
    understanding of the ecology and evolution of the taxonomically hyperdiverse
    microbial communities is limited. Here, we review current knowledge of plant
    genotypic and phenotypic traits as well as allogenic and autogenic factors
    that shape microbiome composition and functions. We give specific emphasis
    to the impact of plant domestication on microbiome assembly and how insights
    into microbiomes of wild plant relatives and native habitats can contribute
    to reinstate or enrich for microorganisms with beneficial effects on plant
    growth, development, and health. Finally, we introduce new concepts and
    perspectives in plant microbiome research, in particular how community
    ecology theory can provide a mechanistic framework to unravel the interplay
    of distinct ecological processes?i.e., selection, dispersal, drift,
    diversification?that structure the plant microbiome. Expected final online
    publication date for the Annual Review of Microbiology Volume 73 is
    September 9, 2019. Please see

    Patterns of hybrid seed inviability in perennials of the *Mimulus guttatus*

  abstract: >-
    Ecological divergence is a fundamental source of phenotypic diversity
    between closely related species, yet the genetic architecture of most
    ecologically relevant traits is poorly understood. Differences in elevation
    can impose substantial divergent selection on both complex, correlated
    suites of traits (such as life-history), as well as novel adaptations. We
    use the
                  Mimulus guttatus
                  species complex to assess if the divergence in elevation is accompanied by trait divergence in a group of closely related perennials and determine the genetic architecture of this divergence. We find that divergence in elevation is associated with differences in life-history, as well as a unique trait, the production of rhizomes. The divergence between two perennials is largely explained by few mid-to-large effect quantitative trait loci (QTLs). However, the presence of QTLs with correlated, but opposing effects on multiple traits leads to some hybrids with transgressive trait combinations. Lastly, we find that the genetic architecture of the ability to produce rhizomes changes through development, wherein most hybrids produce rhizomes, but only later in development. Our results suggest that elevational differences may shape life-history divergence between perennials, but aspects of the genetic architecture of divergence may have implications for hybrid fitness in nature.

    Herbarium specimens represent important records of morphological and genetic
    diversity of plants that inform questions relevant to global change,
    including species distributions, phenology and functional traits. It is
    increasingly appreciated that plant microbiomes can influence these aspects
    of plant biology, but little is known regarding the historic distribution of
    microbes associated with plants collected in the pre-molecular age. If
    microbiomes can be observed reliably in herbarium specimens, researchers
    will gain a new lens with which to examine microbial ecology, evolution,
    species interactions. Here, we describe a method for accessing historical
    plant microbiomes from preserved herbarium specimens, providing a proof of
    concept using two plant taxa from the imperiled boreal biome (
                  Andromeda polifolia
                  and
                  Ledum palustre
                  subsp
                  . groenlandicum,
                  Ericaceae). We focus on fungal endophytes, which occur within symptomless plant tissues such as leaves. Through a three-part approach (i.e. culturing, cloning and next-generation amplicon sequencing via the Illumina MiSeq platform, with extensive controls), we examined endophyte communities in dried, pressed leaves that had been processed as regular herbarium specimens and stored at room temperature in a herbarium for four years
                  .
                  We retrieved only one endophyte in culture, but cloning and especially the MiSeq analysis revealed a rich community of foliar endophytes. The phylogenetic distribution and diversity of endophyte assemblages, especially among the Ascomycota, resemble endophyte communities from fresh plants collected in the boreal biome. We could distinguish communities of endophytes in each plant species and differentiate likely endophytes from fungi that could be surface contaminants. Taxa found by cloning were observed in the larger MiSeq dataset, but species richness was greater when subsets of the same tissues were evaluated with the MiSeq approach. Our findings provide a proof of concept for capturing endophyte DNA from herbarium specimens, supporting the importance of herbarium records as roadmaps for understanding the dynamics of plant-associated microbial biodiversity in the Anthropocene.
                
                This article is part of the theme issue ‘Biological collections for understanding biodiversity in the Anthropocene’.

    Although bryophytes are a dominant vegetation component of boreal and alpine
    ecosystems, little is known about their associated fungal communities. HPLC
    assays of ergosterol (fungal biomass) and amplicon pyrosequencing of the
    ITS2 region of rDNA were used to investigate how the fungal communities
    associated with four bryophyte species changed across an elevational
    gradient transitioning from conifer forest to the lowalpine. Fungal biomass
    and OTU richness associated with the four moss hosts did not vary
    significantly across the gradient (P > 0.05), and both were more strongly
    affected by host and tissue type. Despite largely constant levels of fungal
    biomass, distinct shifts in community composition of fungi associated with
    Hylocomium, Pleurozium and Polytrichum occurred between the elevation zones
    of the gradient. This likely is a result of influence on fungal communities
    by major environmental factors such as temperature, directly or indirectly
    mediated by, or interacting with, the response of other components of the
    vegetation (i.e. the dominant trees). Fungal communities associated with
    Dicranum were an exception, exhibiting spatial autocorrelation between
    plots, and no significant structuring by elevation. Nevertheless, the
    detection of distinct fungal assemblages associated with a single host
    growing in different elevation zones along an elevational gradient is of
    particular relevance in the light of the ongoing changes in vegetation
    patterns in boreal and alpine systems due to global climate warming.

    The accuracy of microbial community surveys based on marker-gene and
    metagenomic sequencing (MGS) suffers from the presence of contaminants—DNA
    sequences not truly present in the sample. Contaminants come from various
    sources, including reagents. Appropriate laboratory practices can reduce
    contamination, but do not eliminate it. Here we introduce decontam
    (https://github.com/benjjneb/decontam), an open-source R package that
    implements a statistical classification procedure that identifies
    contaminants in MGS data based on two widely reproduced patterns:
    contaminants appear at higher frequencies in low-concentration samples and
    are often found in negative controls.

    We characterized the fungal community found in the winter seasonal snow of
    the Antarctic Peninsula. From the samples of snow, 234 fungal isolates were
    obtained and could be assigned to 51 taxa of 26 genera. Eleven yeast species
    displayed the highest densities; among them, Phenoliferia glacialis showed a
    broad distribution and was detected at all sites that were sampled. Fungi
    known to be opportunistic in humans were subjected to antifungal minimal
    inhibition concentration. Debaryomyces hansenii, Rhodotorula mucilaginosa,
    Penicillium chrysogenum, Penicillium sp. 3, and Penicillium sp. 4 displayed
    resistance against the antifungals benomyl and fluconazole. Among them, R.
    mucilaginosa isolates were able to grow at 37 °C. Our results show that the
    winter seasonal snow of the Antarctic Peninsula contains a diverse fungal
    community dominated by cosmopolitan ubiquitous fungal species previously
    found in tropical, temperate, and polar ecosystems. The high densities of
    these cosmopolitan fungi suggest that they could be present in the air that
    arrives at the Antarctic Peninsula by air masses from outside Antarctica.
    Additionally, we detected environmental fungal isolates that were resistant
    to agricultural and clinical antifungals and able to grow at 37 °C. Further
    studies will be needed to characterize the virulence potential of these
    fungi in humans and animals.

    Abstract
                Host genetics has recently been shown to be a driver of plant microbiome composition. However, identifying the underlying genetic loci controlling microbial selection remains challenging. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) represent a potentially powerful, unbiased method to identify microbes sensitive to the host genotype and to connect them with the genetic loci that influence their colonization. Here, we conducted a population-level microbiome analysis of the rhizospheres of 200 sorghum genotypes. Using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, we identify rhizosphere-associated bacteria exhibiting heritable associations with plant genotype, and identify significant overlap between these lineages and heritable taxa recently identified in maize. Furthermore, we demonstrate that GWAS can identify host loci that correlate with the abundance of specific subsets of the rhizosphere microbiome. Finally, we demonstrate that these results can be used to predict rhizosphere microbiome structure for an independent panel of sorghum genotypes based solely on knowledge of host genotypic information.

    European forest ecosystems span many different ecological zones and are rich
    in tree species. The environment in which the trees grow similarly affects
    fungal communities that interact with these trees. Fungal pathogens can
    cause severe damage to trees and potentially impair forest stability. In
    particular, pathogens that damage the foliage will affect the tree’s
    photosynthetic ability, partly or completely. At the same time, pathogens
    can create niches for different plants by removing dominant species. The
    foliage community also comprises fungal species whose ecological functions
    are not entirely known and may either positively or negatively impact the
    tree’s health status.


    The aim of this thesis was to understand the effect of tree species
    diversity in mitigating fungal pathogen damage and in affecting the fungal
    community distribution. To achieve this, visual assessment of leaves for
    pathogen damages was carried out on 16 different tree species from six
    European forests. The fungal communities of Norway spruce needles from four
    European forests were studied by using next generation sequencing
    technology, and fungal communities of birch leaves by sequencing and
    morphological assessment. In this thesis, foliar fungal pathogen damages
    were positively correlated with tree species richness – latitude
    interaction, suggesting that tree species diversity may regulate pathogens
    but was dependent on the forest. Additionally, foliar fungal community
    composition was found to differ significantly in different forests, which
    may be attributable to local environmental effects or reflect the
    evolutionary history of the host tree, and thereby this study contributes to
    the understanding of biogeographic patterns of microorganisms. Finally,
    methods used to study fungal communities revealed that the sequencing-based
    method provided a richer picture of the fungal community than morphological
    assessment of fungal structures and symptoms, though neither method informed
    the distribution patterns as it relates to tree species diversity. Overall,
    impact of tree species diversity on foliar fungal distribution may not be
    strong, but it invites us to consider other factors that interact with
    fungal communities and how fungi may in turn shape their environment.

    Abstract Motivation: Next-generation sequencing produces vast amounts of
    data with errors that are difficult to distinguish from true biological
    variation when coverage is low. Results: We demonstrate large reductions in
    error frequencies, especially for high-error-rate reads, by three
    independent means: (i) filtering reads according to their expected number of
    errors, (ii) assembling overlapping read pairs and (iii) for amplicon reads,
    by exploiting unique sequence abundances to perform error correction. We
    also show that most published paired read assemblers calculate incorrect
    posterior quality scores. Availability and implementation: These methods are
    implemented in the USEARCH package. Binaries are freely available at
    http://drive5.com/usearch. Contact:  robert@drive5.com Supplementary

    Fungal symbionts that live asymptomatically inside plant tissues
    (endophytes) can influence plant-insect interactions. Recent work has shown
    that damage by leaf-cutting ants, a major Neotropical defoliator, is reduced
    to almost half in plants with high densities of endophytes. We investigated
    changes in the phenotype of leaves that could influence ants' behavior to
    result in the reduction of foliar damage. We produced cucumber seedlings
    with high and low densities of one common endophyte species, Colletotrichum
    tropicale. We used the leaves in bioassays and to compare chemical and
    physical leaf characteristics important for ants' food selection. Ants cut
    about one-third more area of cucumber leaves with lower densities of
    endophytes and removed c. 20% more paper disks impregnated with the extracts
    of those leaves compared with leaves and disks from plants hosting the
    fungus. Colletotrichum tropicale colonization did not cause detectable
    changes in the composition of volatile compounds, cuticular waxes, nutrients
    or leaf toughness. Our study shows that endophytes changed leaf chemistry
    and suggests that compounds with relative low volatility released after leaf
    wounding are a major factor influencing foraging decisions by ants when
    choosing between plants with low or high endophyte loads. © 2013 New

    Abstract Motivation: Fast and accurate quality control is essential for
    studies involving next-generation sequencing data. Whilst numerous tools
    exist to quantify QC metrics, there is no common approach to flexibly
    integrate these across tools and large sample sets. Assessing analysis
    results across an entire project can be time consuming and error prone;
    batch effects and outlier samples can easily be missed in the early stages
    of analysis. Results: We present MultiQC, a tool to create a single report
    visualising output from multiple tools across many samples, enabling global
    trends and biases to be quickly identified. MultiQC can plot data from many
    common bioinformatics tools and is built to allow easy extension and
    customization. Availability and implementation: MultiQC is available with an
    GNU GPLv3 license on GitHub, the Python Package Index and Bioconda.

    Speciation can occur on both large and small geographical scales. In plants,
    local speciation, where small populations split off from a large-ranged
    progenitor species, is thought to be the dominant mode, yet there are still
    few examples to verify speciation has occurred in this manner. A recently
    described morphological species in the yellow monkey flowers, Mimulus
    filicifolius, is an excellent candidate for local speciation because of its
    highly restricted geographical range. Mimulus filicifolius was formerly
    identified as a population of M. laciniatus due to similar lobed leaf
    morphology and rocky outcrop habitat. To investigate whether M. filicifolius
    is genetically divergent and reproductively isolated from M. laciniatus, we
    examined patterns of genetic diversity in ten nuclear and eight
    microsatellite loci, and hybrid fertility in M. filicifolius and its
    purported close relatives: M. laciniatus, M. guttatus and M. nasutus. We
    found that M. filicifolius is genetically divergent from the other species
    and strongly reproductively isolated from M. laciniatus. We conclude that M.
    filicifolius is an independent rock outcrop specialist despite being
    morphologically and ecologically similar to M. laciniatus, and that its
    small geographical range nested within other wide-ranging members of the M.
    guttatus species complex is consistent with local speciation.

    The Genetics of Adaptation to a Harsh Granite Outcrop Environment in
    *Mimulus*
  type: article-journal

  abstract: >-
    Background and Aims The genetic basis of leaf shape has long interested
    botanists because leaf shape varies extensively across the plant kingdom and
    this variation is probably adaptive. However, knowledge of the genetic
    architecture of leaf shape variation in natural populations remains limited.
    This study examined the genetic architecture of leaf shape diversification
    among three edaphic specialists in the Mimulus guttatus species complex.
    Lobed and narrow leaves have evolved from the entire, round leaves of M.
    guttatus in M. laciniatus, M. nudatus and a polymorphic serpentine M.
    guttatus population (M2L). Methods Bulk segregant analysis and
    next-generation sequencing were used to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs)
    that underlie leaf shape in an M. laciniatus∈×∈M. guttatus F2 population. To
    determine whether the same QTLs contribute to leaf shape variation in M.
    nudatus and M2L, F2s from M. guttatus∈×∈M. nudatus and lobed M2L∈×∈unlobed
    M. guttatus crosses were genotyped at QTLs from the bulk segregant analysis.
    Key Results Narrow and lobed leaf shapes in M. laciniatus, M. nudatus and M.
    guttatus are controlled by overlapping genetic regions. Several promising
    leaf shape candidate genes were found under each QTL. Conclusions The
    evolution of divergent leaf shape has taken place multiple times in the M.
    guttatus species complex and is associated with the occupation of dry, rocky
    environments. The genetic architecture of elongated and lobed leaves is
    similar across three species in this group. This may indicate that parallel
    genetic evolution from standing variation or new mutations is responsible
    for the putatively adaptive leaf shape variation in Mimulus.

    Identifying the individual loci and mutations that underlie adaptation to
    extreme environments has long been a goal of evolutionary biology. However,
    finding the genes that underlie adaptive traits is difficult for several
    reasons. First, because many traits and genes evolve simultaneously as
    populations diverge, it is difficult to disentangle adaptation from neutral
    demographic processes. Second, finding the individual loci involved in any
    trait is challenging given the respective limitations of quantitative and
    population genetic methods. In this issue of Molecular Ecology, Hendrick et
    al. (2016) overcome these difficulties and determine the genetic basis of
    microgeographic adaptation between geothermal vent and nonthermal
    populations of Mimulus guttatus in Yellowstone National Park. The authors
    accomplish this by combining population and quantitative genetic techniques,
    a powerful, but labour-intensive, strategy for identifying individual
    causative adaptive loci that few studies have used (Stinchcombe & Hoekstra
    ). In a previous common garden experiment (Lekberg et al. 2012), thermal M.
    guttatus populations were found to differ from their closely related
    nonthermal neighbours in various adaptive phenotypes including trichome
    density. Hendrick et al. (2016) combine quantitative trait loci (QTL)
    mapping, population genomic scans for selection and admixture mapping to
    identify a single genetic locus underlying differences in trichome density
    between thermal and nonthermal M. guttatus. The candidate gene, R2R3 MYB, is
    homologous to genes involved in trichome development across flowering
    plants. The major trichome QTL, Tr14, is also involved in trichome density
    differences in an independent M. guttatus population comparison (Holeski et
    al. 2010) making this an example of parallel genetic evolution.

    The genetic architecture of local adaptation has been of central interest to
    evolutionary biologists since the modern synthesis. In addition to classic
    theory on the effect size of adaptive mutations by Fisher, Kimura and Orr,
    recent theory addresses the genetic architecture of local adaptation in the
    face of ongoing gene flow. This theory predicts that with substantial gene
    flow between populations local adaptation should proceed primarily through
    mutations of large effect or tightly linked clusters of smaller effect loci.
    In this study, we investigate the genetic architecture of divergence in
    flowering time, mating system-related traits, and leaf shape between Mimulus
    laciniatus and a sympatric population of its close relative M. guttatus.
    These three traits are probably involved in M. laciniatus' adaptation to a
    dry, exposed granite outcrop environment. Flowering time and mating system
    differences are also reproductive isolating barriers making them 'magic
    traits'. Phenotypic hybrids in this population provide evidence of recent
    gene flow. Using next-generation sequencing, we generate dense SNP markers
    across the genome and map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) involved in
    flowering time, flower size and leaf shape. We find that interspecific
    divergence in all three traits is due to few QTL of large effect including a
    highly pleiotropic QTL on chromosome 8. This QTL region contains the
    pleiotropic candidate gene TCP4 and is involved in ecologically important
    phenotypes in other Mimulus species. Our results are consistent with theory,
    indicating that local adaptation and reproductive isolation with gene flow
    should be due to few loci with large and pleiotropic effects.

    Understanding which environmental variables and traits underlie adaptation
    to harsh environments is difficult because many traits evolve simultaneously
    as populations or species diverge. Here, we investigate the ecological
    variables and traits that underlie Mimulus laciniatus’ adaptation to granite
    outcrops compared to its sympatric, mesic-adapted progenitor, Mimulus
    guttatus. We use fine-scale measurements of soil moisture and herbivory to
    examine differences in selective forces between the species’ habitats, and
    measure selection on flowering time, flower size, plant height, and leaf
    shape in a reciprocal transplant using M. laciniatus × M. guttatus F4
    hybrids. We find that differences in drought and herbivory drive survival
    differences between habitats, that M. laciniatus and M. guttatus are each
    better adapted to their native habitat, and differential habitat selection
    on flowering time, plant stature, and leaf shape. Although early flowering
    time, small stature, and lobed leaf shape underlie plant fitness in M.
    laciniatus’ seasonally dry environment, increased plant size is advantageous
    in a competitive mesic environment replete with herbivores like M.
    guttatus’. Given that we observed divergent selection between habitats in
    the direction of species differences, we conclude that adaptation to
    different microhabitats is an important component of reproductive isolation
    in this sympatric species pair.

    Abstract
                As climate change progresses, we are observing widespread changes in phenotypes in many plant populations. Whether these phenotypic changes are directly caused by climate change, and whether they result from phenotypic plasticity or evolution, are active areas of investigation. Here, we review terrestrial plant studies addressing these questions. Plastic and evolutionary responses to climate change are clearly occurring. Of the 38 studies that met our criteria for inclusion, all found plastic or evolutionary responses, with 26 studies showing both. These responses, however, may be insufficient to keep pace with climate change, as indicated by eight of 12 studies that examined this directly. There is also mixed evidence for whether evolutionary responses are adaptive, and whether they are directly caused by contemporary climatic changes. We discuss factors that will likely influence the extent of plastic and evolutionary responses, including patterns of environmental changes, species’ life history characteristics including generation time and breeding system, and degree and direction of gene flow. Future studies with standardized methodologies, especially those that use direct approaches assessing responses to climate change over time, and sharing of data through public databases, will facilitate better predictions of the capacity for plant populations to respond to rapid climate change.

    Abstract We have designed two taxon‐selective primers for the internal
    transcribed spacer (ITS) region in the nuclear ribosomal repeat unit. These
    primers, ITS1‐F and ITS4‐B, were intended to be specific to fungi and
    basidiomycetes, respectively. We have tested the specificity of these
    primers against 13 species of ascomycetes, 14 of basidiomycetes, and 15 of
    plants. Our results showed that ITS4‐B, when paired with either a
    ‘universal’ primer ITS1 or the fungal‐specific primer ITS1‐F, efficiently
    amplified DNA from all basidiomycetes and discriminated against ascomycete
    DNAs. The results with plants were not as clearcut. The ITS1‐F/ITS4‐B primer
    pair produced a small amount of PCR product for certain plant species, but
    the quantity was in most cases less than that produced by the ‘universal’
    ITS primers. However, under conditions where both plant and fungal DNAs were
    present, the fungal DNA was amplified to the apparent exclusion of plant
    DNA. ITS1‐F/ITS4‐B preferential amplification was shown to be particularly
    useful for detection and analysis of the basidiomycete component in
    ectomycorrhizae and in rust‐infected tissues. These primers can be used to
    study the structure of ectomycorrhizal communities or the distribution of
    rusts on alternate hosts.

                  Premise of the study:
                  Fungal endophytes are symbionts that inhabit aboveground tissues of most terrestrial plants and can affect plant physiology and growth under stressed conditions. In a future faced with substantial climate change, endophytes have the potential to play an important role in plant stress resistance. Understanding both the distributions of endophytes and their functioning in symbiosis with plants are key aspects of predicting their role in an altered climate.
                
                
                  •
                  Methods:
                  Here we characterized endophytes in grasses across a steep precipitation gradient to examine the relative importance of environmental and spatial factors in structuring endophyte communities. We also tested how 20 endophytes isolated from drier and wetter regions performed in symbiosis with grass seedlings under high and low soil moisture in the greenhouse.
                
                
                  •
                  Key results:
                  Environmental factors related to historical and current precipitation were the most important predictors of endophyte communities in the field. On average, endophytic fungi from western sites also reduced plant water loss in the greenhouse compared to fungi from eastern sites. However, there was substantial variability in how individual endophytic taxa affected plant traits under high and low water availability, with up to two orders of magnitude difference in the plasticity of plant traits conferred by the different fungal taxa.
                
                
                  •
                  Conclusions:
                  While species sorting appears to largely explain local endophyte community composition, their function in symbiosis is not predictable from local environmental conditions. The development of a predictive framework for endophyte function will require further study of individual fungal taxa and genotypes across environmental gradients.

    Horizontally-transmitted foliar endophytic fungi can moderate plant
    tolerance to abiotic and biotic stress. Previous studies have found
    correlations between climate and endophyte beta diversity, but were
    unable to clearly separate drivers related to long-term climate, annual
    weather, and host plants. To address this, we characterized endophyte
    communities in the perennial C-4 grass, Panicum hallii, across a
    precipitation gradient in central Texas over 3 years. A total of 65
    unique leaf endophytes were isolated and identified based on ITS and LSU
    regions of rDNA. Mean annual rainfall and temperature were the primary
    drivers of endophyte richness and community composition, followed by
    annual weather conditions. In contrast, little explanatory value was
    provided by plant host traits, vegetation structure, or spatial factors.
    The importance of historical climate and annual weather in endophyte
    distributions suggests that species sort by environment and are likely
    to be affected by future climate change. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The

    Summary
                
                  
                    
                      All terrestrial plants are colonized by foliar endophytic fungi that can affect plant growth and physiology, but the prediction of these effects on the plant host remains a challenge. Here, we examined three paradigms that potentially control how endophytes affect plant hosts: habitat adaptation, evolutionary history and functional traits.
                    
                    
                      
                        We screened 35 plant–endophyte pairings in a microcosm experiment under well‐watered and drought conditions with
                        Panicum virgatum
                        as the host. We related the measured plant responses to fungal phylogenetic relatedness, characteristics of fungal habitats across a rainfall gradient and functional traits of the fungi related to stress tolerance and resource use.
                      
                    
                    
                      The functional traits and habitat characteristics of the fungi predicted 26–53% of endophyte‐mediated effects on measures of plant growth, physiology and survival. Overall, survival was higher for plants grown with more stress‐tolerant fungi, and aboveground biomass was enhanced by fungi from warmer and drier habitats. Plant growth and physiology were also dependent on fungal resource use indicators; however, specific predictors were dependent on water availability.
                    
                    
                      Simple ecological traits of foliar endophytic fungi observed in culture can translate to symbiotic lifestyles. These findings offer new insights and key testable predictions for likely pathways by which endophytes benefit the plant host.

    Abstract
                Fungal endophytes colonize living internal plant tissues without causing any visible symptoms of disease. Endophytic fungi associated with healthy leaves may play an important role in the protection of hosts against herbivores and pathogens. In this study, the diversity of foliar endophytic fungi (FEF) of the southern temperate tree Embothrium coccineum (Proteaceae), as well as their role in plant protection in nature was determined. Fungal endophytes were isolated from 40 asymptomatic leaves by the culture method for molecular identification of the 18S rRNA gene. A relationship between FEF frequency and plant protection was evaluated in juveniles of E. coccineum . Fungal endophyte frequency was estimated using real-time PCR analyses to determine endophyte DNA content per plant. A total of 178 fungal isolates were identified, with sequence data revealing 34 different operational taxonomic units (OTUs). A few common taxa dominated the fungal endophyte community, whereas most taxa qualified as rare. A significant positive correlation between plant protection (evaluated in terms of percentage of leaf damage) and FEF frequency was found. Furthermore, in vitro confrontation assays indicated that FEF were able to inhibit the growth of fungal pathogens. The data showed a relatively high diversity of fungal endophytes associated with leaves of E. coccineum , and suggest a positive relationship between fungal endophyte frequencies in leaves and host protection in nature.

    Abstract
                
                  
                    
                      Despite the ubiquitous presence of fungal endophytes in woody plants, mechanisms underlying variation in foliar fungal endophyte communities are poorly understood. Given that endophytes in woody plants are predominantly horizontally transmitted, fungal endophyte colonization of foliar tissues is likely to be influenced by plant resistance traits. Here, we evaluated the association between leaf resistance traits and colonization and community composition of horizontally transmitted endophytes (HTE) in 10 dominant trees species in a temperate rainforest in Southern Chile. Because resistance traits might restrict colonization of HTE, it was hypothesized that host trees with similar leaf resistance traits would show similar HTE communities.
                    
                    
                      We measured leaf traits with reported roles in plant resistance against pathogens and/or herbivores: cell wall polysaccharides, leaf toughness, flavonoids, anthocyanins, terpenoids and chitinases. We also determined variation in fungal read counts, number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs), diversity and community structure across tree species. Foliar fungal endophyte communities were characterized using Illumina MiSeq sequencing of tagged amplicons of the ITS1 region.
                    
                    
                      
                        Fungal read counts were significantly different among host trees, while number of OTUs and diversity were similar among them. Multivariate analyses showed that community composition of endophytic fungi significantly differed among hosts, and that variation in cell wall, flavonoids, anthocyanins and terpenoids was associated with differences in HTE communities. We found that host trees sharing leaf resistance traits harbour similar HTE communities. Fungal read counts decreased with increasing content of cell wall polysaccharides, while endophyte diversity decreased with increasing anthocyanin levels. Fungal read counts, in contrast, were positively associated with terpenoids. Additionally, culture‐based data indicated that some HTE strains inhibited the growth of the common fungal pathogen

                        Synthesis
                        . Overall, we found that leaf resistance traits may influence fungal endophyte colonization and community composition in tree species, likely through deterrent effects of structural and chemical traits. We suggest that endophytic fungi that overcome resistance traits might play a role in plant protection.

    Abstract
                
                  
                    
                      Fungal endophytes (FE) are an important component of leaf microbial communities. They usually live asymptomatically within leaf tissues; however, FE can provide additional defensive features against microbial pathogens to the host. Leaf functional traits (LFTs) regulate FE entry, colonization and community composition in plants.
                    
                    
                      There is evidence that thin leaves with less structural and chemical traits but high nutrient content are more prone to FE colonization than well‐defended thick leaves. This illustrates the relevance of trade‐offs (= an increase in a trait, with a decrease in another trait) in LFTs, suggesting that the leaf economics spectrum (LES, which describes relationships in a suite of leaf traits aligned from a resource‐acquisitive to a resource‐conservative ecological strategy) may be a predictor of FE colonization and community composition in plants.
                    
                    
                      We hypothesize that LES‐modulated changes in the leaf internal environment (i.e. thin, low‐defended vs. thick, well‐defended leaves) will (a) have consequences for host resistance to pathogens due to changes in the FE colonization and diversity and, subsequently, in the foliar chemical profile and (b) may cause a switch in FE behaviour to a pathogenic lifestyle.
                    
                    
                      
                        Synthesis
                        . Still, our knowledge of how the coexistence between host plants and FE is regulated remains limited. LFTs may act as relevant ecological hub of FE colonization, community composition and life behaviour in natural ecosystems, with potential bottom‐up effects on other organisms, including pathogens. We highlight and discuss critical aspects in this topic and end by proposing new avenues of research in this emerging field.

    Plant microbiota can greatly impact plant growth, defense, and health in
    different environments. Thus, it might be evolutionarily beneficial for
    plants to be able to control processes related to microbiota assembly.
    Dioecious plant species display sexual dimorphism in morphology, physiology,
    and immunity. These differences imply that male and female individuals might
    differently regulate their microbiota, but the role of sex in microbiota
    assembly has been largely neglected so far. Here, we introduce the mechanism
    of how sex controls microbiota in plants analogically to the sex regulation
    of gut microbiota in animals, in particular in humans. We argue that plant
    sex imposes selective pressure on filtering and constructing microbiota in
    the rhizosphere, phyllosphere, and endosphere along the soil-plant
    continuum. Since male plants are more resistant than female plants to
    environmental stresses, we suggest that a male host forms more stable and
    resistant plant microbiota that cooperate more effectively with the host to
    resist stresses. Male and female plants can distinguish whether a plant is
    of the same or different sex, and males can alleviate stress-caused damage
    in females. The impact of a male host on microbiota would protect female
    plants from unfavorable environments.

    Summary
                The interiors of plants are colonized by diverse microorganisms that are referred to as endophytes. Endophytes have received much attention over the past few decades, yet many questions remain unanswered regarding patterns in their biodiversity at local to global scales. To characterize research effort to date, we synthesized results from ~600 published studies. Our survey revealed a global research interest and highlighted several gaps in knowledge. For instance, of the 17 biomes encompassed by our survey, 7 were understudied and together composed only 7% of the studies that we considered. We found that fungal endophyte diversity has been characterized in at least one host from 30% of embryophyte families, while bacterial endophytes have been surveyed in hosts from only 10.5% of families. We complimented our survey with a vote counting procedure to determine endophyte richness patterns among plant tissue types. We found that variation in endophyte assemblages in above‐ground tissues varied with host growth habit. Stems were the richest tissue in woody plants, whereas roots were the richest tissue in graminoids. For forbs, we found no consistent differences in relative tissue richness among studies. We propose future directions to fill the gaps in knowledge we uncovered and inspire further research.

    The foliar microbiome can extend the host plant phenotype by expanding its
    genomic and metabolic capabilities. Despite increasing recognition of the
    importance of the foliar microbiome for plant fitness, stress physiology,
    and yield, the diversity, function, and contribution of foliar microbiomes
    to plant phenotypic traits remain largely elusive. The recent adoption of
    high-throughput technologies is helping to unravel the diversityand
    spatiotemporal dynamics of foliar microbiomes, but we have yet to resolve
    their functional importance for plant growth, development, and ecology.
    Here, we focus on the processes that govern the assembly of the foliar
    microbiome and the potential mechanisms involved in extended plant
    phenotypes. We highlight knowledge gaps and provide suggestions for new
    research directions that can propel the field forward. These efforts will be
    instrumental in maximizing the functional potential of the foliar microbiome
    for sustainable crop production.

    Abstract
                The microbiome shapes many host traits, yet the biology of microbiomes challenges traditional evolutionary models. Here, we illustrate how integrating the microbiome into quantitative genetics can help untangle complexities of host-microbiome evolution. We describe two general ways in which the microbiome may affect host evolutionary potential: by shifting the mean host phenotype and by changing the variance in host phenotype in the population. We synthesize the literature across diverse taxa and discuss how these scenarios could shape the host response to selection. We conclude by outlining key avenues of research to improve our understanding of the complex interplay between hosts and microbiomes.

    Engineering new functions in the microbiome requires understanding how host
    genetic control and microbe-microbe interactions shape the microbiome. One
    key genetic mechanism underlying host control is the immune system. The
    immune system can promote stability in the composition of the microbiome by
    reshaping the ecological dynamics of its members, but the degree of
    stability will depend on the interplay between ecological context, immune
    system development, and higher-order microbe-microbe interactions. The
    eco-evolutionary interplay affecting composition and stability should inform
    the strategies used to engineer new functions in the microbiome. We conclude
    with recent methodological developments that provide an important path
    forward for both engineering new functionality in the microbiome and broadly
    understanding how ecological interactions shape evolutionary processes in
    complex biological systems.

    Most studies examining endophytic fungi associated with grasses (Poaceae)
    have focused on agronomically important species in managed ecosystems or on
    wild grasses in subtropical, temperate and boreal grasslands. However
    grasses first arose in tropical forests, where they remain a significant and
    diverse component of understory and forest-edge communities. To provide a
    broader context for understanding grass-endophyte associations we
    characterized fungal endophyte communities inhabiting foliage of 11 species
    of phylogenetically diverse C3 grasses in the understory of a lowland
    tropical forest at Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Our sample included
    members of early-arising subfamilies of Poaceae that are endemic to forests,
    as well as more recently arising subfamilies that transitioned to open
    environments. Isolation on culture media and direct PCR and cloning revealed
    that these grasses harbor species-rich and phylogenetically diverse
    communities that lack the endophytic Clavicipitaceae known from diverse
    woodland and pasture grasses in the temperate zone. Both the incidence and
    diversity of endophytes was consistent among grass species regardless of
    subfamily, clade affiliation or ancestral habitat use. Genotype and
    phylogenetic analyses suggest that these endophytic fungi are predominantly
    host generalists, shared not only among distinctive lineages of Poaceae but
    also with non-grass plants at the same site. © 2011 by The Mycological

    Plant-symbiotic fungi influence the structure and function of all
    terrestrial ecosystems, but factors shaping their distributions in time and
    space are rarely well understood. Grasses (Poaceae), which first arose and
    diversified in tropical forests, harbor diverse but little-studied
    endophytes in the lowland forests of Panama. We used sequence data for 402
    isolates from two sampling years, 11 host species, and 55 microsites at
    Barro Colorado Island, Panama to investigate the influence of host and
    habitat (soil type, forest age) in shaping endophyte diversity and
    composition. In contrast to previous studies, we found no evidence for host-
    or habitat specificity. Instead, endophytes demonstrated strong spatial
    structure consistent with dispersal limitation, with community similarity
    decaying markedly over a scale of hundreds of meters. Spatial structure that
    is independent of host species and habitat reveals remarkable heterogeneity
    of endophyte-host associations at small geographic scales and adds an
    important spatial component to extrapolative estimates of fungal diversity.

    Insect herbivory is a major driving force of plant evolution. Phenotypic
    plasticity and developmental variation provide a means for plants to cope
    with variable herbivory. We characterized the genetics of developmental
    variation and phenotypic plasticity in trichome density, a putative
    defensive trait of Mimulus guttatus (yellow monkeyflower). Our results are
    evaluated in relation to the optimal defense theory, which provides testable
    predictions for plastic and developmental patterns in defense traits. We
    found that both developmental stage and simulated insect damage affected
    trichome production, but in different ways. Plants were more likely to
    produce at least some trichomes on later leaves than on earlier leaves,
    regardless of damage. Damage did not affect the average probability of
    producing trichomes, but it did increase the density of hairs on
    trichome-positive plants. We mapped trichome quantitative trait loci (QTL)
    by selectively genotyping a large panel of recombinant inbred lines derived
    from two highly divergent populations. Several highly pleiotropic QTL
    influenced multiple aspects of the trichome phenotype (constitutive,
    developmental, and/or plastic responses). Only one of the QTL influenced
    trichome induction following damage. In a result that is consistent with a
    central prediction of optimal defense theory, the high allele at this
    location was from the ancestral population with low constitutive trichome
    production. © 2010 by The University of Chicago.

    Abstract
                
                  Motivation
                  Microbiome datasets provide rich information about microbial communities. However, vast library size variations across samples present great challenges for proper statistical comparisons. To deal with these challenges, rarefaction is often used in practice as a normalization technique, although there has been debate whether rarefaction should ever be used. Conventional wisdom and previous work suggested that rarefaction should never be used in practice, arguing that rarefying microbiome data is statistically inadmissible. These discussions, however, have been confined to particular parametric models and simulation studies.
                
                
                  Results
                  We develop a semiparametric graphical model framework for grouped microbiome data and analyze in the context of differential abundance testing the statistical trade-offs of the rarefaction procedure, accounting for latent variations and measurement errors. Under the framework, it can be shown rarefaction guarantees that subsequent permutation tests properly control the Type I error. In addition, the loss in sensitivity from rarefaction is solely due to increased measurement error; if the underlying variation in microbial composition is large among samples, rarefaction might not hurt subsequent statistical inference much. We develop the rarefaction efficiency index (REI) as an indicator for efficiency loss and illustrate it with a dataset on the effect of storage conditions for microbiome data. Simulation studies based on real data demonstrate that the impact of rarefaction on sensitivity is negligible when overdispersion is prominent, while low REI corresponds to scenarios in which rarefying might substantially lower the statistical power. Whether to rarefy or not ultimately depends on assumptions of the data generating process and characteristics of the data.

    Aim Ecologists have generally agreed that -diversity is driven at least in
    part by ecological processes and mechanisms of community assembly and is a
    key determinant of global patterns of species richness. This idea has been
    challenged by a recent study based on an individual-based null model
    approach, which aims to account for the species pool. The goal of the
    present study is twofold: (1) to analyse data sets from different parts of
    the world to determine whether there are significant latitude-diversity
    gradients after accounting for the species pool, and (2) to evaluate the
    validity of the null model. Location Global. Methods A total of 257 forest
    plots, each being 0.1 ha in size and having 10 0.01-ha subplots, were used.
    We conducted four sets of analyses. A modified version of Whittaker's
    -diversity index was used to quantify -diversity for each forest plot. A
    randomization procedure was used to determine expected -diversity. Results
    The number of individuals per species, which characterizes species abundance
    distribution, alone explains 56.884.2% of the variation in observed
    -diversity. Species pool (-diversity) explained only an additional 2.615.2%
    of the variation in observed -diversity. Latitude explains 18.6% of the
    variation in raw deviation in Gentry's global data set, and explains
    11.011.6% of the variation in standardized deviation in the global and three
    regional analyses. Latitude explains 33.246.2% of the variation in the
    number of individuals per species. Main conclusions Species abundance
    distribution, rather than species pool size, plays a key role in driving
    latitude-diversity gradients for -diversity in local forest communities. The
    individual-based null model is not a valid null model for investigating
    -diversity gradients driven by mechanisms of local community assembly
    because the null model incorporates species abundance distributions, which
    are driven by mechanisms of local community assembly and in turn generate
    -diversity gradients.

    Identifying the factors that influence the outcome of host-microbial
    interactions is critical to protecting biodiversity, minimizing agricultural
    losses and improving human health. A few genes that determine symbiosis or
    resistance to infectious disease have been identified in model species, but
    a comprehensive examination of how a host genotype influences the structure
    of its microbial community is lacking. Here we report the results of a field
    experiment with the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to identify the fungi
    and bacteria that colonize its leaves and the host loci that influence the
    microbe numbers. The composition of this community differs among accessions
    of A. thaliana. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) suggest that plant
    loci responsible for defense and cell wall integrity affect variation in
    this community. Furthermore, species richness in the bacterial community is
    shaped by host genetic variation, notably at loci that also influence the
    reproduction of viruses, trichome branching and morphogenesis.

    Despite long-standing interest in elevational-diversity gradients, little is
    known about the processes that cause changes in the compositional variation
    of communities (β-diversity) across elevations. Recent studies have
    suggested that β-diversity gradients are driven by variation in species
    pools, rather than by variation in the strength of local community assembly
    mechanisms such as dispersal limitation, environmental filtering, or local
    biotic interactions. However, tests of this hypothesis have been limited to
    very small spatial scales that limit inferences about how the relative
    importance of assembly mechanisms may change across spatial scales. Here, we
    test the hypothesis that scale-dependent community assembly mechanisms shape
    biogeographic β-diversity gradients using one of the most well-characterized
    elevational gradients of tropical plant diversity. Using an extensive
    dataset on woody plant distributions along a 4,000-m elevational gradient in
    the Bolivian Andes, we compared observed patterns of β-diversity to
    null-model expectations. β-deviations (standardized differences from null
    values) were used to measure the relative effects of local community
    assembly mechanisms after removing sampling effects caused by variation in
    species pools. To test for scale-dependency, we compared elevational
    gradients at two contrasting spatial scales that differed in the size of
    local assemblages and regions by at least an order of magnitude. Elevational
    gradients in β-diversity persisted after accounting for regional variation
    in species pools. Moreover, the elevational gradient in β-deviations changed
    with spatial scale. At small scales, local assembly mechanisms were
    detectable, but variation in species pools accounted for most of the
    elevational gradient in β-diversity. At large spatial scales, in contrast,
    local assembly mechanisms were a dominant force driving changes in
    β-diversity. In contrast to the hypothesis that variation in species pools
    alone drives β-diversity gradients, we show that local community assembly
    mechanisms contribute strongly to systematic changes in β-diversity across
    elevations. We conclude that scale-dependent variation in community assembly
    mechanisms underlies these iconic gradients in global biodiversity.

    Abstract   As more attentions have been paid to microbial taxonomic
    community structure along altitudinal gradients, the knowledge of the
    altitudinal variations in microbial functional structure in terrestrial
    ecosystems is limited. More importantly, the dominant assembly processes
    that drive altitudinal variations in both taxonomic composition and
    functional structure remain unclear. To fill the gaps, we integrated soil
    prokaryotic taxonomic community structure, functional community structure
    and community assembly processes along an altitudinal gradient into a
    comprehensive understanding. The results revealed that both taxonomic
    community structure and core functional community structure of soil
    prokaryotic microbes significantly differed across altitudes. We detected
    the core functional groups associated with the redox reactions essential for
    microbial metabolism and biogeochemical cycles across altitudes.
    Chemoheterotrophy and photoautotrophy were dominant in abundance, indicating
    the important roles of primary energy metabolism for soil prokaryotic
    community. The whole prokaryotic community taxonomic composition was
    dominantly shaped by dispersal limitation (governing 74% of spatial
    turnover). The variation of functional structure was primarily caused by
    environmental selection, while the taxonomic variation within individual
    functional groups was weakly related to selection but mainly driven by
    drift. These results are critical for predicting the future dynamics of soil
    microbial community in the face of disturbances.

    Entropies such as the Shannon–Wiener and Gini–Simpson indices are not
    themselves diversities. Conversion of these to effective number of species
    is the key to a unified and intuitive interpretation of diversity. Effective
    numbers of species derived from standard diversity indices share a common
    set of intuitive mathematical properties and behave as one would expect of a
    diversity, while raw indices do not. Contrary to Keylock, the lack of
    concavity of effective numbers of species is irrelevant as long as they are
    used as transformations of concave alpha, beta, and gamma entropies. The
    practical importance of this transformation is demonstrated by applying it
    to a popular community similarity measure based on raw diversity indices or
    entropies. The standard similarity measure based on untransformed indices is
    shown to give misleading results, but transforming the indices or entropies
    to effective numbers of species produces a stable, easily interpreted,
    sensitive general similarity measure. General overlap measures derived from
    this transformed similarity measure yield the Jaccard index, Sørensen index,
    Horn index of overlap, and the Morisita–Horn index as special cases.

    Climate is a potent selective force in natural populations, yet the
    importance of adaptation in the response of plant species to past climate
    change has been questioned. As many species are unlikely to migrate fast
    enough to track the rapidly changing climate of the future, adaptation must
    play an increasingly important role in their response. In this paper we
    review recent work that has documented climate-related genetic diversity
    within populations or on the microgeographical scale. We then describe
    studies that have looked at the potential evolutionary responses of plant
    populations to future climate change. We argue that in fragmented
    landscapes, rapid climate change has the potential to overwhelm the capacity
    for adaptation in many plant populations and dramatically alter their
    genetic composition. The consequences are likely to include unpredictable
    changes in the presence and abundance of species within communities and a
    reduction in their ability to resist and recover from further environmental
    perturbations, such as pest and disease outbreaks and extreme climatic
    events. Overall, a range-wide increase in extinction risk is likely to
    result. We call for further research into understanding the causes and
    consequences of the maintenance and loss of climate-related genetic
    diversity within populations. ©2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.

    Endophytic fungi produce various mixtures of carbon-based compounds, which
    are known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Research regarding the use
    of VOCs as pesticide substitutes has garnered much attention. This review
    summarizes the recent knowledge about VOCs regarding their origin and
    chemical properties and emphasizes their antimicrobial potential against a
    wide variety of agricultural pathogens. Several studies have highlighted the
    importance of VOCs as antimicrobial agents. Nevertheless, the application of
    VOCs in biofumigation methods still requires the advanced evaluation of
    their phytotoxicity.

    Abstract
                
                  Plants are colonized by distinct pathogenic and commensal microbiomes across different regions of the globe, but the factors driving their geographic variation are largely unknown. Here, using 16S ribosomal DNA and shotgun sequencing, we characterized the associations of the
                  Arabidopsis thaliana
                  leaf microbiome with host genetics and climate variables from 267 populations in the species’ native range across Europe. Comparing the distribution of the 575 major bacterial amplicon variants (phylotypes), we discovered that microbiome composition in
                  A. thaliana
                  segregates along a latitudinal gradient. The latitudinal clines in microbiome composition are predicted by metrics of drought, but also by the spatial genetics of the host. To validate the relative effects of drought and host genotype we conducted a common garden field study, finding 10% of the core bacteria to be affected directly by drought and 20% to be affected by host genetic associations with drought. These data provide a valuable resource for the plant microbiome field, with the identified associations suggesting that drought can directly and indirectly shape genetic variation in
                  A. thaliana
                  via the leaf microbiome.

    Climate change is shifting altitudinal species ranges, with potential to
    disrupt species interactions. Altitudinal gradient studies and warming
    experiments can both increase understanding of climate effects on species
    interactions, but few studies have used both together to improve
    predictions. We examined whether plant–fungal symbioses responded similarly
    to altitude and 23yr of experimental warming. Root‐ and leaf‐associated
    fungi, which can mediate plants’ climate sensitivity, responded divergently
    to elevation vs. warming. Fungal colonization, diversity, and composition
    varied with altitude, but climate variables were generally weak predictors;
    other factors such as host plant identity, plant community composition, or
    edaphic variables likely drive fungal altitudinal distributions. Manipulated
    warming altered fungal colonization, but not composition or diversity. Leaf
    symbionts were more sensitive to climate and experimental warming than root
    symbionts. Altitudinal patterns and responses to warming differed among host
    plant species and fungal groups, indicating that predicting climate effects
    on symbioses will require tracking both host and symbiont identities.
    Combining experimental and observational methods can yield valuable insight
    into how climate change may alter plant–symbiont interactions, but our
    results indicate that altitude does not always serve as an adequate proxy
    for warming effects on fungal symbionts of plants.

    The evolution of self-fertilization from outcrossing is one of the most
    common evolutionary transitions in flowering plants. One goal of our
    research is to develop a linkage map based upon microsatellite loci in
    Mimulus guttatus and the selfing derivative M. nasutus in order to examine
    the genetics of one such transition. Here we present 19 primer pairs that
    detect polymorphisms between these two species. Within-population allelic
    surveys demonstrate the value of these markers for detailed analysis of
    population structure. We have found also that many of the microsatellites
    are conserved in more distantly related Mimulus species, and may thus serve
    as useful genetic markers for population genetic and comparative mapping
    studies within this diverse genus.

    Background and AimsLeaf life span is widely recognized as a key life history
    trait associated with herbivory resistance, but rigorous comparative data
    are rare for seedlings. The goal of this study was to examine how light
    environment affects leaf life span, and how ontogenetic development during
    the first year may influence leaf fracture toughness, lamina density and
    stem density that are relevant for herbivory resistance, leaf life span and
    seedling survival.MethodsData from three experiments encompassing 104
    neotropical woody species were combined. Leaf life span, lamina and vein
    fracture toughness, leaf and stem tissue density and seedling survival were
    quantified for the first-year seedlings at standardized ontogenetic stages
    in shade houses and common gardens established in gaps and shaded
    understorey in a moist tropical forest in Panama. Mortality of naturally
    recruited seedlings till 1 year later was quantified in 800 1-m2 plots from
    1994 to 2011.Key ResultsMedian leaf life span ranged widely among species,
    always greater in shade (ranging from 151 to >1790 d in the understorey and
    shade houses) than in gaps (115-867 d), but with strong correlation between
    gaps and shade. Leaf and stem tissue density increased with seedling age,
    whereas leaf fracture toughness showed only a weak increase. All these
    traits were positively correlated with leaf life span. Leaf life span and
    stem density were negatively correlated with seedling mortality in shade,
    while gap mortality showed no correlation with these traits.ConclusionsThe
    wide spectrum of leaf life span and associated functional traits reflects
    variation in shade tolerance of first-year seedlings among coexisting trees,
    shrubs and lianas in this neotropical forest. High leaf tissue density is
    important in enhancing leaf toughness, a known physical defence, and leaf
    life span. Both seedling leaf life span and stem density should be
    considered as key functional traits that contribute to seedling survival in
    tropical forest understoreys. © The Author 2013.

    While direct plant responses to global change have been well characterized,
    indirect plant responses to global change, via altered species interactions,
    have received less attention. Here, we examined how plants associated with
    four classes of fungal symbionts (class I leaf endophytes [EF], arbuscular
    mycorrhizal fungi [AMF], ectomycorrhizal fungi [ECM], and dark septate
    endophytes [DSE]) responded to four global change factors (enriched CO
                  2
                  , drought, N deposition, and warming). We performed a meta‐analysis of 434 studies spanning 174 publications to search for generalizable trends in responses of plant–fungal symbioses to future environments. Specifically, we addressed the following questions: (1) Can fungal symbionts ameliorate responses of plants to global change? (2) Do fungal symbiont groups differ in the degree to which they modify plant response to global change? (3) Do particular global change factors affect plant–fungal symbioses more than others? In all global change scenarios, except elevated CO
                  2
                  , fungal symbionts significantly altered plant responses to global change. In most cases, fungal symbionts increased plant biomass in response to global change. However, increased N deposition reduced the benefits of symbiosis. Of the global change factors we considered, drought and N deposition resulted in the strongest fungal mediation of plant responses. Our analysis highlighted gaps in current knowledge for responses of particular fungal groups and revealed the importance of considering not only the nonadditive effects of multiple global change factors, but also the interactive effects of multiple fungal symbioses. Our results show that considering plant–fungal symbioses is critical to predicting ecosystem response to global change.

    Abstract   Endophytic fungi inhabit the leaf tissues of all living plants
    where they can buffer or exacerbate plant responses to climate change.
    Because many of these fungi have only recently been discovered and
    sequenced, the independent and interactive responses of plants and their
    fungal symbionts to a warming climate is an area of active research. Here we
    describe a conceptual framework linking the range of phenotypic plasticity
    and rates of shifts in community composition of each symbiont (plants and
    fungal leaf endophytes) to overall changes in abundance of each organism in
    a 26-year-long warming experiment in the Colorado Rocky Mountains. In this
    system, leaf endophytic fungi exhibit large plasticity in growth rates in
    response to experimental warming in the laboratory, but no shifts in
    composition after 26years of warming in the field. Instead, fungal
    composition in the field changed in response to plant species composition.
    In contrast, the C3 grasses examined in this study shifted in composition in
    response to field warming within 4years. In addition, the abundance of
    individual fungi was much more variable among field temperatures than that
    of plants. Overall, we find support that fungi are potentially more
    phenotypically plastic in response to warming whereas plants are more likely
    to shift composition.

    Direct and indirect influences of warming on leaf endophytic fungi: A
    physiological and compositional approach
  type: article-journal

  abstract: >-
    Fungal symbionts can buffer plants from environmental extremes and may
    affect host capacities to acclimate, adapt, or redistribute under
    environmental change; however, the distributions of fungal symbionts along
    abiotic gradients are poorly described. Fungal mutualists should be the most
    beneficial in abiotically stressful environments, and the structure of
    networks of plant-fungal interactions likely shift along gradients, even
    when fungal community composition does not track environmental stress. We
    sampled 634 unique combinations of fungal endophytes and mycorrhizal fungi,
    grass species identities, and sampling locations from 66 sites across six
    replicate altitudinal gradients in the western Colorado Rocky Mountains. The
    diversity and composition of leaf endophytic, root endophytic, and
    arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal guilds and the overall abundance of
    fungal functional groups (pathogens, saprotrophs, mutualists) tracked grass
    host identity more closely than elevation. Network structures of root
    endophytes become more nested and less specialized at higher elevations, but
    network structures of other fungal guilds did not vary with elevation.
    Overall, grass species identity had overriding influence on the diversity
    and composition of above- and belowground fungal endophytes and AM fungi,
    despite large environmental variation. Therefore, in our system climate
    change may rarely directly affect fungal symbionts. Instead, fungal symbiont
    distributions will most likely track the range dynamics of host grasses.

    Summary
                
                  Twenty‐five years ago,
                  Arabidopsis thaliana
                  emerged as the model organism of choice for research in plant biology. A consensus was reached about the need to focus on a single organism to integrate the classical disciplines of plant science with the expanding fields of genetics and molecular biology. Ten years after publication of its genome sequence, Arabidopsis remains the standard reference plant for all of biology. We reflect here on the major advances and shared resources that led to the extraordinary growth of the Arabidopsis research community. We also underscore the importance of continuing to expand and refine our detailed knowledge of Arabidopsis while seeking to appreciate the remarkable diversity that characterizes the plant kingdom.

    Increases in species turnover of woody plants at low latitudes and
    elevations are explained by the size of species pools alone.
              , 
                Understanding spatial variation in biodiversity along environmental gradients is a central theme in ecology. Differences in species compositional turnover among sites (β diversity) occurring along gradients are often used to infer variation in the processes structuring communities. Here, we show that sampling alone predicts changes in β diversity caused simply by changes in the sizes of species pools. For example, forest inventories sampled along latitudinal and elevational gradients show the well-documented pattern that β diversity is higher in the tropics and at low elevations. However, after correcting for variation in pooled species richness (γ diversity), these differences in β diversity disappear. Therefore, there is no need to invoke differences in the mechanisms of community assembly in temperate versus tropical systems to explain these global-scale patterns of β diversity.

    The vascular plant Arabidopsis thaliana is a central genetic model and
    universal reference organism in plant and crop science. The successful
    integration of different fields of research in the study of A. thaliana has
    made a large contribution to our molecular understanding of key concepts in
    biology. The availability and active development of experimental tools and
    resources, in combination with the accessibility of a wealth of cumulatively
    acquired knowledge about this plant, support the most advanced systems
    biology approaches among all land plants. Research in molecular ecology and
    evolution has also brought the natural history of A. thaliana into the
    limelight. This article showcases our current knowledge of the natural
    history of A. thaliana from the perspective of the most closely related
    plant species, providing an evolutionary framework for interpreting novel
    findings and for developing new hypotheses based on our knowledge of this
    plant.

    We present a new multivariate technique for testing the significance of
    individual terms in a multifactorial analysis-of-variance model for
    multispecies response variables. The technique will allow researchers to
    base analyses on measures of association (distance measures) that are
    ecologically relevant. In addition, unlike other distance-based
    hypothesis-testing techniques, this method allows tests of significance of
    interaction terms in a linear model. The technique uses the existing method
    of redundancy analysis (RDA) but allows the analysis to be based on
    Bray-Curtis or other ecologically meaningful measures through the use of
    principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). Steps in the procedure include: (1)
    calculating a matrix of distances among replicates using a distance measure
    of choice (e.g., Bray-Curtis); (2) determining the principal coordinates
    (including a correction for negative eigenvalues, if necessary), which
    preserve these distances; (3) creating a matrix of dummy variables
    corresponding to the design of the experiment (i.e., individual terms in a
    linear model); (4) analyzing the relationship between the principal
    coordinates (species data) and the dummy variables (model) using RDA; and
    (5) implementing a test by permutation for particular statistics
    corresponding to the particular terms in the model. This method has certain
    advantages not shared by other multivariate testing procedures. We
    demonstrate the use of this technique with experimental ecological data from
    intertidal assemblages and show how the presence of significant multivariate
    interactions can be interpreted. It is our view that distance-based RDA will
    be extremely useful to ecologists measuring multispecies responses to
    structured multifactorial experimental designs.

    Summary 1. Tests of significance of the individual canonical axes in
    redundancy analysis allow researchers to determine which of the axes
    represent variation that can be distinguished from random. Variation along
    the significant axes can be mapped, used to draw biplots or interpreted
    through subsequent analyses, whilst the nonsignificant axes may be dropped
    from further consideration. 2. Three methods have been implemented in
    computer programs to test the significance of the canonical axes; they are
    compared in this paper. The simultaneous test of all individual canonical
    axes, which is appealing because of its simplicity, produced incorrect
    (highly inflated) levels of type I error for the axes following those
    corresponding to true relationships in the data, so it is invalid. The
    ‘marginal’ testing method implemented in the ‘vegan’ R package and the
    ‘forward’ testing method implemented in the program CANOCO were found to
    have correct levels of type I error and comparable power. Permutation of the
    residuals achieved greater power than permutation of the raw data. 3. R
    functions found in a Supplement to this paper provide the first formal
    description of the ‘marginal’ and ‘forward’ testing methods.

    successfully being used for analysing ecological data, using a clear and
    comprehensive approach. These methods are derived from the fields of
    mathematical physics, parametric and nonparametric statistics, information
    theory, numerical taxonomy, archaeology, psychometry, sociometry, econometry
    and others. Relates ecological questions to methods of statistical analysis,
    with a clear description of complex numerical methods. All methods are
    illustrated by examples from the ecological literature so that ecologists
    clearly see how to use the methods and approaches in their own research. All

    Abstract Background Current solid-phase reversible immobilization (SPRI)
    beads technology is widely used in molecular biology due to its convenience
    for DNA manipulation. However, the high performance commercial SPRI beads
    have no price advantage over our method. Furthermore, the use of
    commercially available SPRI beads standards does not provide the flexibility
    required for a number of specific nucleic acid handling scenarios. Results
    We report an efficient DNA purification strategy by combining home-made
    beads-suspension buffer with SPRI beads. The method tests the critical
    concentrations of polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000 and beads to maximise
    recovery. And the composition of the SPRI beads DNA purification system
    (SDPS) was determined at 20% PEG 8000, 2 M NaCl and 16.3 mM MgCl 2 , and
    1.25 mg/ml beads (1/8th original concentration). Then, we tested the DNA
    recovery of the SDPS, and the result showed that it was comparable to the
    control (AMPure XP beads). In the study, we have also developed an
    adjustment SPRI beads DNA purification system (ASDPS), the volume of ASDPS
    per reaction is 0.6× reaction volume (beads/samples). The performance of
    ASDPS is similar to SDPS and the control. But the cost of our methods is
    only about 1/24th of the control. To further assess its performance, we
    prepare the DNA-seq libraries to evaluate the yield, library quality,
    capture efficiency and consistency. We have compared all these results with
    the performance of the control and confirmed its efficiency. Conclusion We
    have proposed an alternative DNA purification approach with great
    flexibility, allowing researchers to manipulate DNA in different conditions.
    And ultimately, its application will benefit molecular biology research in
    the future.

  abstract: "Abstract\n            \n              Long-term climate change and periodic environmental extremes threaten food and fuel security\n              1\n              and global crop productivity\n              2–4\n              . Although molecular and adaptive breeding strategies can buffer the effects of climatic stress and improve crop resilience\n              5\n              , these approaches require sufficient knowledge of the genes that underlie productivity and adaptation\n              6\n              —knowledge that has been limited to a small number of well-studied model systems. Here we present the assembly and annotation of the large and complex genome of the polyploid bioenergy crop switchgrass (\n              Panicum virgatum\n              ). Analysis of biomass and survival among 732\_resequenced genotypes, which were grown across 10\_common gardens that span 1,800\_km of latitude, jointly revealed extensive genomic evidence of climate adaptation. Climate–gene–biomass associations were abundant but varied considerably among deeply diverged gene pools. Furthermore, we found that gene flow accelerated climate adaptation during the postglacial colonization of northern habitats through introgression of alleles from a pre-adapted northern gene pool. The polyploid nature of switchgrass also enhanced adaptive potential through the fractionation of gene function, as there was an increased level of heritable genetic diversity on the nondominant subgenome. In addition to investigating patterns of climate adaptation, the genome resources and gene–trait associations developed here provide breeders with the necessary tools to increase switchgrass yield for the sustainable production of bioenergy."

    Since the colonization of land by ancestral plant lineages 450 million years
    ago, plants and their associated microbes have been interacting with each
    other, forming an assemblage of species that is often referred to as a
    “holobiont.” Selective pressure acting on holobiont components has likely
    shaped plant-associated microbial communities and selected for host-adapted
    microorganisms that impact plant fitness. However, the high microbial
    densities detected on plant tissues, together with the fast generation time
    of microbes and their more ancient origin compared to their host, suggest
    that microbe-microbe interactions are also important selective forces
    sculpting complex microbial assemblages in the phyllosphere, rhizosphere,
    and plant endosphere compartments. Reductionist approaches conducted under
    laboratory conditions have been critical to decipher the strategies used by
    specific microbes to cooperate and compete within or outside plant tissues.
    Nonetheless, our understanding of these microbial interactions in shaping
    more complex plant-associated microbial communities, along with their
    relevance for host health in a more natural context, remains sparse. Using
    examples obtained from reductionist and community-level approaches, we
    discuss the fundamental role of microbe-microbe interactions (prokaryotes
    and micro-eukaryotes) for microbial community structure and plant health. We
    provide a conceptual framework illustrating that interactions among
    microbiota members are critical for the establishment and the maintenance of
    host-microbial homeostasis.

    ABSTRACT
                Complex microbial communities are associated with plants and can improve their resilience under harsh environmental conditions. In particular, plants and their associated communities have developed complex adaptation strategies against cold stress. Although changes in plant-associated microbial community structure have been analysed in different cold regions, scarce information is available on possible common taxonomic and functional features of microbial communities across cold environments. In this review, we discuss recent advances in taxonomic and functional characterization of plant-associated microbial communities in three main cold regions, such as alpine, Arctic and Antarctica environments. Culture-independent and culture-dependent approaches are analysed, in order to highlight the main factors affecting the taxonomic structure of plant-associated communities in cold environments. Moreover, biotechnological applications of plant-associated microorganisms from cold environments are proposed for agriculture, industry and medicine, according to biological functions and cold adaptation strategies of bacteria and fungi. Although further functional studies may improve our knowledge, the existing literature suggest that plants growing in cold environments harbor complex, host-specific and cold-adapted microbial communities, which may play key functional roles in plant growth and survival under cold conditions.

    Leaf defenses have long been studied in the context of plant growth rate,
    resource availability, and optimal investment theory. Likewise, one of the
    central modern paradigms of plant ecophysiology, the leaf economics spectrum
    (LES), has been extensively studied in the context of these factors across
    ecological scales ranging from global species data sets to temporal shifts
    within individuals. Despite strong physiological links between LES strategy
    and leaf defenses in structure, function, and resource investment, the
    relationship between these trait classes has not been well explored. This
    study investigates the relationship between leaf defenses and LES strategy
    across whole-plant ontogeny in three diverse Helianthus species known to
    exhibit dramatic ontogenetic shifts in LES strategy, focusing primarily on
    physical and quantitative chemical defenses. Plants were grown under
    controlled environmental conditions and sampled for LES and defense traits
    at four ontogenetic stages. Defenses were found to shift strongly with
    ontogeny, and to correlate strongly with LES strategy. More advanced
    ontogenetic stages with more conservative LES strategy leaves had higher
    tannin activity and toughness in all species, and higher leaf dry matter
    content in two of three species. Modeling results in two species support the
    conclusion that changes in defenses drive changes in LES strategy through
    ontogeny, and in one species that changes in defenses and LES strategy are
    likely independently driven by ontogeny. Results of this study support the
    hypothesis that leaf-level allocation to defenses might be an important
    determinant of leaf economic traits, where high investment in defenses
    drives a conservative LES strategy.

    Plants harbor a large diversity of endophytic microbes. Meadow fescue
    (Festuca pratensis) is a cool-season grass known for its symbiotic
    relationship with the systemic and vertically—via seeds—transmitted fungal
    endophyte Epichloë uncinata, yet its effects on plant hormones and the
    microbial community is largely unexplored. Here, we sequenced the endophytic
    bacterial and fungal communities in the leaves and roots, analyzing
    phytohormone concentrations and plant performance parameters in
    Epichloë-symbiotic (E+) and Epichloë-free (E-) individuals of two meadow
    fescue cultivars. The endophytic microbial community differed between leaf
    and root tissues independent of Epichloë symbiosis, while the fungal
    community was different in the leaves of Epichloë-symbiotic and
    Epichloë-free plants in both cultivars. At the same time, Epichloë symbiosis
    decreased salicylic acid and increased auxin concentrations in leaves.
    Epichloë-symbiotic plants showed higher biomass and higher seed mass at the
    end of the season. Our results demonstrate that Epichloë symbiosis alters
    the leaf fungal microbiota, which coincides with changes in phytohormone
    concentrations, indicating that Epichloë endophytes affect both plant immune
    responses and other fungal endophytes. Whether the effect of Epichloë
    endophytes on other fungal endophytes is connected to changes in
    phytohormone concentrations remains to be elucidated.

    Nonparametric multivariate analysis of ecological data using permutation
    tests has two main challenges: (1) to partition the variability in the data
    according to a complex design or model, as is often required in ecological
    experiments, and (2) to base the analysis on a multivariate distance measure
    (such as the semimetric Bray-Curtis measure) that is reasonable for
    ecological data sets. Previous nonparametric methods have succeeded in one
    or other of these areas, but not in both. A recent contribution to
    Ecological Monographs by Legendre and Anderson, called distance-based
    redundancy analysis (db-RDA), does achieve both. It does this by calculating
    principal coordinates and subsequently correcting for negative eigenvalues,
    if they are present, by adding a constant to squared distances. We show here
    that such a correction is not necessary. Partitioning can be achieved
    directly from the distance matrix itself, with no corrections and no
    eigenanalysis, even if the distance measure used is semimetric. An
    ecological example is given to show the differences in these statistical
    methods. Empirical simulations, based on parameters estimated from real
    ecological species abundance data, showed that db-RDA done on multifactorial
    designs (using the correction) does not have type 1 error consistent with
    the significance level chosen for the analysis (i.e., does not provide an
    exact test), whereas the direct method described and advocated here does.

    Fungal endophytes isolated from healthy Theobroma cacao tissues were
    screened in vitro for antagonism against major pathogens of cacao. Of tested
    endophytic morphospecies, 40% (21/52), 65% (28/43) and 27% percent (4/15)
    showed in vitro antagonism against Moniliophthora roreri (frosty pod rot),
    Phytophthora palmivora (black pod rot) and Moniliophthora perniciosa
    (witches broom), respectively. The most common antagonistic mechanism was
    simple competition for substrate. Nonetheless, 13%, 21%, and 0% of tested
    morphospecies showed clear antibiosis against M. roreri, P. palmivora, and
    M. perniciosa, respectively. One isolate of Trichoderma was observed to be
    parasitic on M. roreri. Endophyte species that were common in the host
    plants under natural conditions often are good colonizers and grow fast in
    vitro whereas antibiosis producers usually appear to be relatively rare in
    nature, tend to grow slowly in vitro, and often are not good colonizers. We
    suggest that there is an inherent general trade-off between fast growth
    (high colonization) and production of chemicals that produce antibiosis
    reactions. Finally, field trials assessing the effects of three endophytic
    fungi (Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Clonostachys rosea and Botryosphaeria
    ribis) on pod loss due to M. roreri and Phytophthora spp. were conducted at
    four farms in Panama. Although the overall incidence of black pod rot was
    very low during the tests, treatment with C. gloeosporioides significantly
    decreased pod loss due to that disease. We observed no decrease in pod loss
    due to frosty pod rot, but treatment with C. rosea reduced the incidence of
    cacao pods with sporulating lesions of M. roreri by 10%. The observed
    reduction in pod loss due to Phytophthora spp., and sporulation by M.
    roreri, supports the potential of fungal endophytes as biological control
    agents. Further, these studies suggest that combined information from field
    censuses of endophytic fungi, in vitro studies, and greenhouse experiments
    can provide useful a priori criteria for identifying desirable attributes
    for potential biocontrol agents. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

    It is increasingly recognized that macro-organisms (corals, insects, plants,
    vertebrates) consist of both host tissues and multiple microbial symbionts
    that play essential roles in their host's ecological and evolutionary
    success. Consequently, identifying benefits and costs of symbioses, as well
    as mechanisms underlying them are research priorities. All plants surveyed
    under natural conditions harbor foliar endophytic fungi (FEF) in their leaf
    tissues, often at high densities. Despite producing no visible effects on
    their hosts, experiments have nonetheless shown that FEF reduce pathogen and
    herbivore damage. Here, combining results from three genomic, and two
    physiological experiments, we demonstrate pervasive genetic and phenotypic
    effects of the apparently asymptomatic endophytes on their hosts.
    Specifically, inoculation of endophyte-free (E-) Theobroma cacao leaves with
    Colletotrichum tropicale (E+), the dominant FEF species in healthy T. cacao,
    induces consistent changes in the expression of hundreds of host genes,
    including many with known defensive functions. Further, E+ plants exhibited
    increased lignin and cellulose content, reduced maximum rates of
    photosynthesis (Amax), and enrichment of nitrogen-15 and carbon-13 isotopes.
    These phenotypic changes observed in E+ plants correspond to changes in
    expression of specific functional genes in related pathways. Moreover, a
    cacao gene (Tc00g04254) highly up-regulated by C. tropicale also confers
    resistance to pathogen damage in the absence of endophytes or their products
    in host tissues. Thus, the benefits of increased pathogen resistance in E+
    plants are derived in part from up-regulation of intrinsic host defense
    responses, and appear to be offset by potential costs including reduced
    photosynthesis, altered host nitrogen metabolism, and endophyte heterotrophy
    of host tissues. Similar effects are likely in most plant-endophyte
    interactions, and should be recognized in the design and interpretation of
    genetic and phenotypic studies of plants.

    Understanding the processes determining species range limits is central to
    predicting species distributions under climate change. Projected future
    ranges are extrapolated from distribution models based on climate layers,
    and few models incorporate the effects of biotic interactions on species'
    distributions. Here, we show that a positive species interaction ameliorates
    abiotic stress, and has a profound effect on a species' range limits.
    Combining field surveys of 92 populations, 10 common garden experiments
    throughout the range, species distribution models and greenhouse
    experiments, we show that mutualistic fungal endophytes ameliorate drought
    stress and broaden the geographic range of their native grass host Bromus
    laevipes by thousands of square kilometres (~ 20% larger) into drier
    habitats. Range differentiation between fungal-associated and fungal-free
    grasses was comparable to species-level range divergence of congeners,
    indicating large impacts on range limits. Positive biotic interactions may
    be underappreciated in determining species' ranges and species' responses to
    future climates across large geographic scales.

    When addressing the nature of ecological adaptation and environmental
    factors limiting population ranges and contributing to speciation, it is
    important to consider not only the plant's genotype and its response to the
    environment, but also any close interactions that it has with other
    organisms, specifically, symbiotic microorganisms. To investigate this,
    soils and seedlings were reciprocally transplanted into common gardens of
    the big sagebrush hybrid zone in Salt Creek Canyon, Utah, to determine
    location and edaphic effects on the fitness of parental and hybrid plants.
    Endophytic symbionts and functional microbial diversity of indigenous and
    transplanted soils and sagebrush plants were also examined. Strong selection
    occurred against the parental genotypes in the middle hybrid zone garden in
    middle hybrid zone soil; F
                  1
                  hybrids had the highest fitness under these conditions. Neither of the parental genotypes had superior fitness in their indigenous soils and habitats; rather F
                  1
                  hybrids with the nonindigenous maternal parent were superiorly fit. Significant garden‐by‐soil type interactions indicate adaptation of both plant and soil microorganisms to their indigenous soils and habitats, most notably in the middle hybrid zone garden in middle hybrid zone soil. Contrasting performances of F
                  1
                  hybrids suggest asymmetrical gene flow with mountain, rather than basin, big sagebrush acting as the maternal parent. We showed that the microbial community impacted the performance of parental and hybrid plants in different soils, likely limiting the ranges of the different genotypes.

    Gut microbial communities affect their animal hosts in numerous ways,
    motivating investigations of the factors that shape the gut microbiota and
    the consequences of gut microbiota variation for host traits. In this study,
    we tested the effects of increases in environmental temperatures on the gut
    microbiota of fence lizards, a vertebrate ectotherm threatened by warming
    climates. By monitoring lizards and their gut microbes during an
    experimental temperature treatment, we showed that the warming altered and
    destabilized the lizard gut microbiota. Moreover, measuring thermal
    performance of lizard hosts at the end of the experiment indicated that the
    composition of the gut microbiota was associated with host thermal
    tolerance. These results indicate that warming temperatures can alter the
    gut microbiota of vertebrate ectotherms and suggest relationships between
    variation in the gut microbiota and the thermal physiology of natural host
    populations.

                ABSTRACT
                
                  Vertebrates harbor trillions of microorganisms in the gut, collectively termed the gut microbiota, which affect a wide range of host functions. Recent experiments in lab-reared vertebrates have shown that changes in environmental temperature can induce shifts in the gut microbiota, and in some cases these shifts have been shown to affect host thermal physiology. However, there is a lack of information about the effects of temperature on the gut microbiota of wild-caught vertebrates. Moreover, in ectotherms, which are particularly vulnerable to changing temperature regimens, the extent to which microbiota composition is shaped by temperature and associated with host thermal tolerance has not been investigated. To address these issues, we monitored the gut microbiota composition of wild-caught western fence lizards (
                  Sceloporus occidentalis
                  ) experimentally exposed to a cool-to-warm temperature transition. Comparing experimentally exposed and control lizards indicated that warm temperatures altered and destabilized the composition of the
                  S. occidentalis
                  gut microbiota. Warming drove a significant reduction in the relative abundances of a clade of
                  Firmicutes
                  , a significant increase in the rate of compositional turnover in the gut microbiota within individual lizards, and increases in the abundances of bacteria from predicted pathogenic clades. In addition, the composition of the microbiota was significantly associated with the thermal tolerance of lizards measured at the end of the experiment. These results suggest that temperature can alter the lizard gut microbiota, with potential implications for the physiological performance and fitness of natural populations.
                
                
                  IMPORTANCE

    Abstract
                
                  Why do populations remain genetically variable despite strong continuous natural selection? Mutation reconstitutes variation eliminated by selection and genetic drift, but theoretical and experimental studies each suggest that mutation‐selection balance insufficient to explain extant genetic variation in most complex traits. The alternative hypothesis of balancing selection, wherein selection maintains genetic variation, is an aggregate of multiple mechanisms (spatial and temporal heterogeneity in selection, frequency‐dependent selection, antagonistic pleiotropy, etc.). Most of these mechanisms have been demonstrated for Mendelian traits, but there is little comparable data for loci affecting quantitative characters. Here, we report a 3‐year field study of selection on intrapopulation quantitative trait loci (QTL) of flower size, a highly polygenic trait in
                  Mimulus guttatus
                  . The QTL exhibit antagonistic pleiotropy: alleles that increase flower size, reduce viability, but increase fecundity. The magnitude and direction of selection fluctuates yearly and on a spatial scale of metres. This study provides direct evidence of balancing selection mechanisms on QTL of an ecologically relevant trait.

    Evolution by natural selection occurs when the frequencies of genetic
    variants change because individuals differ in Darwinian fitness components
    such as survival or reproductive success. Differential fitness has been
    demonstrated in field studies of many organisms, but it remains unclear how
    well we can quantitatively predict allele frequency changes from fitness
    measurements. Here, we characterize natural selection on millions of Single
    Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome of the annual plant
                  Mimulus guttatus
                  . We use fitness estimates to calibrate population genetic models that effectively predict allele frequency changes into the next generation. Hundreds of SNPs experienced “male selection” in 2013 with one allele at each SNP elevated in frequency among successful male gametes relative to the entire population of adults. In the following generation, allele frequencies at these SNPs consistently shifted in the predicted direction. A second year of study revealed that SNPs had effects on both viability and reproductive success with pervasive trade-offs between fitness components. SNPs favored by male selection were, on average, detrimental to survival. These trade-offs (antagonistic pleiotropy and temporal fluctuations in fitness) may be essential to the long-term maintenance of alleles. Despite the challenges of measuring selection in the wild, the strong correlation between predicted and observed allele frequency changes suggests that population genetic models have a much greater role to play in forward-time prediction of evolutionary change.

  abstract: >-
    Angiosperm leaves manifest a remarkable diversity of shapes that range from
    developmental sequences within a shoot and within crown response to
    microenvironment to variation among species within and between communities
    and among orders or families. It is generally assumed that because
    photosynthetic leaves are critical to plant growth and survival, variation
    in their shape reflects natural selection operating on function. Several
    non-mutually exclusive theories have been proposed to explain leaf shape
    diversity. These include: thermoregulation of leaves especially in arid and
    hot environments, hydraulic constraints, patterns of leaf expansion in
    deciduous species, biomechanical constraints, adaptations to avoid
    herbivory, adaptations to optimise light interception and even that leaf
    shape variation is a response to selection on flower form. However, the
    relative importance, or likelihood, of each of these factors is unclear.
    Here we review the evolutionary context of leaf shape diversification,
    discuss the proximal mechanisms that generate the diversity in extant
    systems, and consider the evidence for each the above hypotheses in the
    context of the functional significance of leaf shape. The synthesis of these
    broad ranging areas helps to identify points of conceptual convergence for
    ongoing discussion and integrated directions for future research.

    Abstract Understanding how species-rich communities persist is a
    foundational question in ecology. In tropical forests, tree diversity is
    structured by edaphic factors, climate, and biotic interactions, with
    seasonality playing an essential role at landscape scales: wetter and less
    seasonal forests typically harbor higher tree diversity than more seasonal
    forests. We posited that the abiotic factors shaping tree diversity extend
    to hyperdiverse symbionts in leaves—fungal endophytes—that influence plant
    health, function, and resilience to stress. Through surveys in forests
    across Panama that considered climate, seasonality, and covarying biotic
    factors, we demonstrate that endophyte richness varies negatively with
    temperature seasonality. Endophyte community structure and taxonomic
    composition reflect both temperature seasonality and climate (mean annual
    temperature and precipitation). Overall our findings highlight the vital
    role of climate-related factors in shaping the hyperdiversity of these
    important and little-known symbionts of the trees that, in turn, form the
    foundations of tropical forest biodiversity.

    Consequences of shifting species distributions
                
                  Climate change is causing geographical redistribution of plant and animal species globally. These distributional shifts are leading to new ecosystems and ecological communities, changes that will affect human society. Pecl
                  et al.
                  review these current and future impacts and assess their implications for sustainable development goals.

                  BACKGROUND
                  The success of human societies depends intimately on the living components of natural and managed systems. Although the geographical range limits of species are dynamic and fluctuate over time, climate change is impelling a universal redistribution of life on Earth. For marine, freshwater, and terrestrial species alike, the first response to changing climate is often a shift in location, to stay within preferred environmental conditions. At the cooler extremes of their distributions, species are moving poleward, whereas range limits are contracting at the warmer range edge, where temperatures are no longer tolerable. On land, species are also moving to cooler, higher elevations; in the ocean, they are moving to colder water at greater depths. Because different species respond at different rates and to varying degrees, key interactions among species are often disrupted, and new interactions develop. These idiosyncrasies can result in novel biotic communities and rapid changes in ecosystem functioning, with pervasive and sometimes unexpected consequences that propagate through and affect both biological and human communities.
                
                
                  ADVANCES
                  At a time when the world is anticipating unprecedented increases in human population growth and demands, the ability of natural ecosystems to deliver ecosystem services is being challenged by the largest climate-driven global redistribution of species since the Last Glacial Maximum. We demonstrate the serious consequences of this species redistribution for economic development, livelihoods, food security, human health, and culture, and we document feedbacks on climate itself. As with other impacts of climate change, species range shifts will leave “winners” and “losers” in their wake, radically reshaping the pattern of human well-being between regions and different sectors and potentially leading to substantial conflict. The pervasive impacts of changes in species distribution transcend single systems or dimensions, with feedbacks and linkages between multiple interacting scales and through whole ecosystems, inclusive of humans. We argue that the negative effects of climate change cannot be adequately anticipated or prepared for unless species responses are explicitly included in decision-making and global strategic frameworks.
                
                
                  OUTLOOK
                  Despite mounting evidence for the pervasive and substantial impacts of a climate-driven redistribution of Earth’s species, current global goals, policies, and international agreements fail to account for these effects. With the predicted intensification of species movements and their diverse societal and environmental impacts, awareness of species “on the move” should be incorporated into local, regional, and global assessments as standard practice. This will raise hope that future targets—whether they be global sustainability goals, plans for regional biodiversity maintenance, or local fishing or forestry harvest strategies—can be achievable and that society is prepared for a world of universal ecological change. Human society has yet to appreciate the implications of unprecedented species redistribution for life on Earth, including for human lives. Even if greenhouse gas emissions stopped today, the responses required in human systems to adapt to the most serious effects of climate-driven species redistribution would be massive. Meeting these challenges requires governance that can anticipate and adapt to changing conditions, as well as minimize negative consequences.
                  
                    
                      As the global climate changes, human well-being, ecosystem function, and even climate itself are increasingly affected by the shifting geography of life.
                      Climate-driven changes in species distributions, or range shifts, affect human well-being both directly (for example, through emerging diseases and changes in food supply) and indirectly (by degrading ecosystem health). Some range shifts even create feedbacks (positive or negative) on the climate system, altering the pace of climate change.
                    
                    
                  
                
              , 
                Distributions of Earth’s species are changing at accelerating rates, increasingly driven by human-mediated climate change. Such changes are already altering the composition of ecological communities, but beyond conservation of natural systems, how and why does this matter? We review evidence that climate-driven species redistribution at regional to global scales affects ecosystem functioning, human well-being, and the dynamics of climate change itself. Production of natural resources required for food security, patterns of disease transmission, and processes of carbon sequestration are all altered by changes in species distribution. Consideration of these effects of biodiversity redistribution is critical yet lacking in most mitigation and adaptation strategies, including the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals.

    Abstract
                Interactions with microbial symbionts have yielded great macroevolutionary innovations across the tree of life, like the origins of chloroplasts and the mitochondrial powerhouses of eukaryotic cells. There is also increasing evidence that host‐associated microbiomes influence patterns of microevolutionary adaptation in plants and animals. Here we describe how microbes can facilitate adaptation in plants and how to test for and differentiate between the two main mechanisms by which microbes can produce adaptive responses in higher organisms: microbe‐mediated local adaptation and microbe‐mediated adaptive plasticity. Microbe‐mediated local adaptation is when local plant genotypes have higher fitness than foreign genotypes because of a genotype‐specific affiliation with locally beneficial microbes. Microbe‐mediated adaptive plasticity occurs when local plant phenotypes, elicited by either the microbial community or the non‐microbial environment, have higher fitness than foreign phenotypes as a result of interactions with locally beneficial microbes. These microbial effects on adaptation can be difficult to differentiate from traditional modes of adaptation but may be prevalent. Ignoring microbial effects may lead to erroneous conclusions about the traits and mechanisms underlying adaptation, hindering management decisions in conservation, restoration, and agriculture.

    We compared the leaf traits and plant performance of 53 co-occurring tree
    species in a semi-evergreen tropical moist forest community. The species
    differed in all leaf traits analyzed: leaf life span varied 11-fold among
    species, specific leaf area 5-fold, mass-based nitrogen 3-fold, mass-based
    assimilation rate 13-fold, mass-based respiration rate 15-fold, stomatal
    conductance 8-fold, and photosynthetic water use efficiency 4-fold.
    Photosynthetic traits were strongly coordinated, and specific leaf area
    predicted mass-based rates of assimilation and respiration; leaf life span
    predicted many other leaf characteristics. Leaf traits were closely
    associated with growth, survival, and light requirement of the species. Leaf
    investment strategies varied on a continuum trading off short-term carbon
    gain against long-term leaf persistence that, in turn, is linked to
    variation in whole-plant growth and survival. Leaf traits were good
    predictors of plant performance, both in gaps and in the forest understory.
    High growth in gaps is promoted by cheap, short-lived, and physiologically
    active leaves. High survival in the forest understory is enhanced by the
    formation of long-lived well protected leaves that reduce biomass loss by
    herbivory, mechanical disturbance, or leaf turnover. Leaf traits underlay
    this growth–survival trade-off; species with short-lived, physiologically
    active leaves have high growth but low survival. This continuum in leaf
    traits, through its effect on plant performance, in turn gives rise to a
    continuum in species' light requirements.

    Abstract
                
                  Motivation
                  Genome-wide datasets produced for association studies have dramatically increased in size over the past few years, with modern datasets commonly including millions of variants measured in dozens of thousands of individuals. This increase in data size is a major challenge severely slowing down genomic analyses, leading to some software becoming obsolete and researchers having limited access to diverse analysis tools.
                
                
                  Results
                  Here we present two R packages, bigstatsr and bigsnpr, allowing for the analysis of large scale genomic data to be performed within R. To address large data size, the packages use memory-mapping for accessing data matrices stored on disk instead of in RAM. To perform data pre-processing and data analysis, the packages integrate most of the tools that are commonly used, either through transparent system calls to existing software, or through updated or improved implementation of existing methods. In particular, the packages implement fast and accurate computations of principal component analysis and association studies, functions to remove single nucleotide polymorphisms in linkage disequilibrium and algorithms to learn polygenic risk scores on millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms. We illustrate applications of the two R packages by analyzing a case–control genomic dataset for celiac disease, performing an association study and computing polygenic risk scores. Finally, we demonstrate the scalability of the R packages by analyzing a simulated genome-wide dataset including 500 000 individuals and 1 million markers on a single desktop computer.

    Aim

    Fungal symbionts are ubiquitous in plants and can mitigate abiotic stressors
    associated with climate change. Predicting fungal symbiont distributions
    under future climates first requires knowledge of current distributions and
    their potential drivers.


    Location

    We documented colonization by fungal symbionts in perennial, cool-season
    grasses along altitudinal gradients in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, USA.


    Methods

    Across seven replicate altitudinal gradients, spanning c.1400 vertical
    meters, we scored fungal colonization for 46 grass species. We documented
    altitudinal clines in colonization by both above-ground and below-ground
    fungal symbionts for the first time, including localized foliar endophytes
    (LFE) and systemic endophytes (epichloae) in leaves and arbuscular
    mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and dark septate endophytes (DSE) in roots. For a
    subset of 16 well-sampled grass species, we used model selection procedures
    to evaluate the relative importance of geography, edaphic factors and host
    plant identity. We also assessed the influence of host phylogenetic
    relatedness and colonization by co-infecting fungi.


    Results

    Levels of fungal colonization varied strongly with host plant identity, but
    the effects of particular host species were not consistent across fungal
    groups. In addition to the influence of host identity, epichloae
    colonization declined with elevation and varied with geography
    (latitude/longitude) and edaphic factors. Geography and collection date were
    important predictors of LFE colonization, with higher colonization later in
    the growing season. Colonization estimates for the obligately
    plant-associated fungi (epichloae, AMF) were phylogenetically conserved
    across the grass supertree. Positive correlations between AMF and DSE, which
    remained even after accounting for host plant relatedness, suggested
    possible synergisms between these fungal groups.


    Main conclusions

    Our survey showed greater host specificity in patterns of fungal
    colonization than prior reports and revealed that different fungal symbiont
    groups do not share similar drivers. Conserving plant–fungal symbioses under
    future climates may require unique strategies for different plant species
    and fungal symbiont types.

    Abstract
                
                  Assembly of microbial communities is the result of neutral and selective processes. However, the relative importance of these processes is still debated. Microbial communities of flowers, in particular, have gained recent attention because of their potential impact to plant fitness and plant‐pollinator interactions. However, the role of selection and dispersal in the assembly of these communities remains poorly understood. Here, we evaluated the role of pollinator‐mediated dispersal on the contribution of neutral and selective processes in the assembly of floral microbiomes of the yellow monkeyflower (
                  Mimulus guttatus
                  ). We sampled floral organs from flowers in the presence and absence of pollinators within five different serpentine seeps in CA and obtained 16S amplicon data on the epiphytic bacterial communities. Consistent with strong microenvironment selection within flowers we observed significant differences in community composition across floral organs and only a small effect of geographic distance. Pollinator exposure affected the contribution of environmental selection and depended on the rate and intimacy of interactions with flower visitors. This study provides evidence of the importance of dispersal and within‐flower heterogeneity in shaping epiphytic bacterial communities of flowers, and highlights the complex interplay between pollinator behaviour, environmental selection and additional abiotic factors in shaping the epiphytic bacterial communities of flowers.

    The discovery of arbuscules in Aglaophyton major, an Early Devonian land
    plant, provides unequivocal evidence that mycorrhizae were established >400
    million years ago. Nonseptate hyphac and arbuscules occur in a specialized
    meristematic region of the cortex that continually provided new cells for
    fungal infection. Arbuscules are morphologically identical to those of
    living arbuscular mycorrhizae in consisting of a basal trunk and repeatedly
    branched bush-like tuft within the plant cell. Although interpretations of
    the evolution of mycorrhizal mutualisms continue to be speculative, the
    existence of arbuscules in the Early Devonian indicates that nutrient
    transfer mutualism may have been in existence when plants invaded the land.

    Interactions between leaf-cutting ants, their fungal symbiont (
                  Leucoagaricus
                  ) and the endophytic fungi within the vegetation they carry into their colonies are still poorly understood. If endophytes antagonistic to
                  Leucoagaricus
                  were found in plant material being carried by these ants, then this might indicate a potential mechanism for plants to defend themselves from leaf-cutter attack. In addition, it could offer possibilities for the management of these important Neotropical pests. Here, we show that, for
                  Atta sexdens rubropilosa
                  , there was a significantly greater incidence of
                  Trichoderma
                  species in the vegetation removed from the nests—and deposited around the entrances—than in that being transported into the nests. In a no-choice test,
                  Trichoderma-
                  infested rice was taken into the nest, with deleterious effects on both the fungal gardens and ant survival. The endophytic ability of selected strains of
                  Trichoderma
                  was also confirmed, following their inoculation and subsequent reisolation from seedlings of eucalyptus. These results indicate that endophytic fungi which pose a threat to ant fungal gardens through their antagonistic traits, such as
                  Trichoderma
                  , have the potential to act as bodyguards of their plant hosts and thus might be employed in a Trojan-horse strategy to mitigate the negative impact of leaf-cutting ants in both agriculture and silviculture in the Neotropics. We posit that the ants would detect and evict such ‘malign’ endophytes—artificially inoculated into vulnerable crops—during the quality-control process within the nest, and, moreover, that the foraging ants may then be deterred from further harvesting of ‘
                  Trichoderma
                  -enriched’ plants.

    Improvements in technology have reduced the cost of DNA sequencing to the
    point that the limiting factor for many experiments is the time and reagent
    cost of sample preparation. We present an approach in which 192 sequencing
    libraries can be produced in a single day of technician time at a cost of
    about $15 per sample. These libraries are effective not only for low-pass
    whole-genome sequencing, but also for simultaneously enriching them in pools
    of approximately 100 individually barcoded samples for a subset of the
    genome without substantial loss in efficiency of target capture. We
    illustrate the power and effectiveness of this approach on about 2000
    samples from a prostate cancer study.

  abstract: "Fungal entomopathogens like\n              Beauveria bassiana\n              (Ascomycota: Hypocreales) are known as antagonists of insects with multiple functional and ecological roles, and have attracted increased attention as biocontrol agents in integrated pest management programmes. For some crop plants, it has been proven that endophytic\n              B.\_bassiana\n              , besides its entomopathogenic habit, can provide protection against plant pathogens or limit their damaging effects. However, for grapevine, limited knowledge is available on the influence of endophytic\n              B.\_bassiana\n              on fungal pathogens and about the mechanisms underlying putative protection effects. This study assessed the protective potential of endophytic\n              B.\_bassiana\n              against grapevine downy mildew\n              Plasmopara viticola\n              in greenhouse experiments. Three and seven days after a\n              B.\_bassiana\n              treatment, potted grapevine plants were inoculated with\n              P.\_viticola\n              and the evolving disease severity was assessed. Disease severity was significantly reduced in\n              B.\_bassiana\n              ‐treated plants compared to control plants, depending on the age of leaves. Furthermore, a microarray and an RT‐qPCR analysis were performed to work out fundamental aspects of genes involved in the interaction between grapevine and\n              B.\_bassiana\n              . The results indicate an up‐regulation of diverse defence‐related genes in grapevine as a response to endophytic establishment of\n              B.\_bassiana\n              . Thus, endophytic establishment of an entomopathogenic fungus such as\n              B.\_bassiana\n              in grapevine plants would represent an alternative and sustainable plant protection strategy, with the potential for reducing pesticide applications in viticulture."

    Background
                  
                    Allergic airway disease (AAD) is a growing concern in industrialized nations and can be influenced by fungal exposures. Basidiomycota yeast species such as
                    Cryptococcus neoformans
                    are known to exacerbate allergic airway disease; however, recent indoor assessments have identified other Basidiomycota yeasts, including
                    Vishniacozyma victoriae
                    (syn.
                    Cryptococcus victoriae
                    ), to be prevalent and potentially associated with asthma. Until now, the murine pulmonary immune response to repeated
                    V. victoriae
                    exposure was previously unexplored.
                  
                
                
                  Objective
                  
                    This study aimed to compare the immunological impact of repeated pulmonary exposure to
                    Cryptococcus
                    yeasts.
                  
                
                
                  Methods
                  
                    Mice were repeatedly exposed to an immunogenic dose of
                    C. neoformans
                    or
                    V. victoriae via
                    oropharyngeal aspiration. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lungs were collected to examine airway remodeling, inflammation, mucous production, cellular influx, and cytokine responses at 1 day and 21 days post final exposure. The responses to
                    C. neoformans
                    and
                    V. victoriae
                    were analyzed and compared.
                  
                
                
                  Results
                  
                    Following repeated exposure, both
                    C. neoformans
                    and
                    V. victoriae
                    cells were still detectable in the lungs 21 days post final exposure. Repeated
                    C. neoformans
                    exposure initiated myeloid and lymphoid cellular infiltration into the lung that worsened over time, as well as an IL-4 and IL-5 response compared to PBS-exposed controls. In contrast, repeated
                    V. victoriae
                    exposure induced a strong CD4
                    +
                    T cell-driven lymphoid response that started to resolve by 21 days post final exposure.
                  
                
                
                  Discussion
                  
                    C. neoformans
                    remained in the lungs and exacerbated the pulmonary immune responses as expected following repeated exposure. The persistence of
                    V. victoriae
                    in the lung and strong lymphoid response following repeated exposure were unexpected given its lack of reported involvement in AAD. Given the abundance in indoor environments and industrial utilization of
                    V. victoriae
                    , these results highlight the importance to investigate the impact of frequently detected fungal organisms on the pulmonary response following inhalational exposure. Moreover, it is important to continue to address the knowledge gap involving Basidiomycota yeasts and their impact on AAD.

    Long-read DNA sequencing technologies require high molecular weight (HMW)
    DNA of adequate purity and integrity, which can be difficult to isolate from
    plant material. Plant leaves usually contain high levels of carbohydrates
    and secondary metabolites that can impact DNA purity, affecting downstream
    applications. Several protocols and kits are available for HMW DNA
    extraction, but they usually require a high amount of input material and
    often lead to substantial DNA fragmentation, making sequencing suboptimal in
    terms of read length and data yield. We here describe a protocol for plant
    HMW DNA extraction from low input material (0.1 g) which is easy to follow
    and quick (2.5 h). This method successfully enabled us to extract HMW from
    four species from different families (Orchidaceae, Poaceae, Brassicaceae,
    Asteraceae). In the case of recalcitrant species, we show that an additional
    purification step is sufficient to deliver a clean DNA sample. We
    demonstrate the suitability of our protocol for long-read sequencing on the
    Oxford Nanopore Technologies PromethION ® platform, with and without the use
    of a short fragment depletion kit.

    Beta‐diversity has been repeatedly shown to decline with increasing
    elevation, but the causes of this pattern remain unclear, partly because
    they are confounded by coincident variation in alpha‐ and gamma‐diversity.
    We used 8795 forest vegetation‐plot records from the Czech National
    Phytosociological Database to compare the observed patterns of beta
    diversity to null‐model expectations (beta‐deviation) controlling for the
    effects of alpha‐ and gamma‐diversity. We tested whether β‐diversity
    patterns along a 1200 m elevation gradient exclusively depend on the effect
    of varying species pool size, or also on the variation of the magnitude of
    community assembly mechanisms determining the distribution of species across
    communities (e.g. environmental filtering, dispersal limitation). The null
    model we used is a novel extension of an existing null‐model designed for
    presence/absence data and was specifically designed to disrupt the effect of
    community assembly mechanisms, while retaining some key features of observed
    communities such as average species richness and species abundance
    distribution. Analyses were replicated in ten subregions with comparable
    elevation ranges. Beta‐diversity declined along the elevation gradient due
    to a decrease in gamma‐diversity, which was steeper than the decrease in
    alpha‐diversity. This pattern persisted after controlling for alpha‐ and
    gamma‐diversity variation, and the results were robust when different
    resampling schemes and diversity metrics were used. We conclude that in
    temperate forests the pattern of decreasing beta‐diversity with elevation
    does not exclusively depend on variation in species pool size, as has been
    hypothesized, but also on variation in community assembly mechanisms. The
    results were consistent across resampling schemes and diversity measures,
    thus supporting the use of vegetation‐plot databases for understanding
    patterns of beta‐diversity at the regional scale.

    Summary
                The design and function of leaf venation are important to plant performance, with key implications for the distribution and productivity of ecosystems, and applications in paleobiology, agriculture and technology. We synthesize classical concepts and the recent literature on a wide range of aspects of leaf venation. We describe 10 major structural features that contribute to multiple key functions, and scale up to leaf and plant performance. We describe the development and plasticity of leaf venation and its adaptation across environments globally, and a new global data compilation indicating trends relating vein length per unit area to climate, growth form and habitat worldwide. We synthesize the evolution of vein traits in the major plant lineages throughout paleohistory, highlighting the multiple origins of individual traits. We summarize the strikingly diverse current applications of leaf vein research in multiple fields of science and industry. A unified core understanding will enable an increasing range of plant biologists to incorporate leaf venation into their research.

    The Janzen-Connell (JC) hypothesis provides a conceptual framework for
    explaining the maintenance of tree diversity in tropical forests. Its
    central tenet - that recruits experience high mortality near conspecifics
    and at high densities - assumes a degree of host specialization in
    interactions between plants and natural enemies. Studies confirming JC
    effects have focused primarily on spatial distributions of seedlings and
    saplings, leaving major knowledge gaps regarding the fate of seeds in soil
    and the specificity of the soilborne fungi that are their most important
    antagonists. Here we use a common garden experiment in a lowland tropical
    forest in Panama to show that communities of seed-infecting fungi are
    structured predominantly by plant species, with only minor influences of
    factors such as local soil type, forest characteristics, or time in soil (1-
    12 months). Inoculation experiments confirmed that fungi affected seed
    viability and germination in a host-specific manner and that effects on seed
    viability preceded seedling emergence. Seeds are critical components of
    reproduction for tropical trees, and the factors influencing their
    persistence, survival, and germination shape the populations of seedlings
    and saplings on which current perspectives regarding forest dynamics are
    based. Together these findings bring seed dynamics to light in the context
    of the JC hypothesis, implicating them directly in the processes that have
    emerged as critical for diversity maintenance in species-rich tropical
    forests.

    Abstract
                All plants, including crop species, harbor a community of fungal endophyte species, yet we know little about the biotic factors that are important in endophyte community assembly. We suggest that the most direct route to understanding the mechanisms underlying community assembly is through the study of functional trait variation in the host and its fungal consortium. We review studies on crop endophytes that investigate plant and fungal traits likely to be important in endophyte community processes. We focus on approaches that could speed detection of general trends in endophyte community assembly: (i) use of the ‘assembly rules’ concept to identify specific mechanisms that influence endophyte community dynamics, (ii) measurement of functional trait variation in plants and fungi to better understand endophyte community processes and plant–fungal interactions, and (iii) investigation of microbe–microbe interactions, and fungal traits that mediate them. This approach is well suited for research in agricultural systems, where pair‐wise host–fungus interactions and mechanisms of fungal–fungal competition have frequently been described. Areas for consideration include the possibility that human manipulation of crop phenotype and deployment of fungal biocontrol species can significantly influence endophyte community assembly. Evaluation of endophyte assembly rules may help to fine‐tune crop management strategies.

    ABSTRACT
                
                  
                  Considering it is common to find as much as 100-fold variation in the number of 16S rRNA gene sequences across samples in a study, researchers need to control for the effect of uneven sequencing effort. How to do this has become a contentious question. Some have argued that rarefying or rarefaction is “inadmissible” because it omits valid data. A number of alternative approaches have been developed to normalize and rescale the data that purport to be invariant to the number of observations. I generated community distributions based on 12 published data sets where I was able to assess the ability of multiple methods to control for uneven sequencing effort. Rarefaction was the only method that could control for variation in uneven sequencing effort when measuring commonly used alpha and beta diversity metrics. Next, I compared the false detection rate and power to detect true differences between simulated communities with a known effect size using various alpha and beta diversity metrics. Although all methods of controlling for uneven sequencing effort had an acceptable false detection rate when samples were randomly assigned to two treatment groups, rarefaction was consistently able to control for differences in sequencing effort when sequencing depth was confounded with treatment group. Finally, the statistical power to detect differences in alpha and beta diversity metrics was consistently the highest when using rarefaction. These simulations underscore the importance of using rarefaction to normalize the number of sequences across samples in amplicon sequencing analyses.
                
                
                  IMPORTANCE
                  Sequencing 16S rRNA gene fragments has become a fundamental tool for understanding the diversity of microbial communities and the factors that affect their diversity. Due to technical challenges, it is common to observe wide variation in the number of sequences that are collected from different samples within the same study. However, the diversity metrics used by microbial ecologists are sensitive to differences in sequencing effort. Therefore, tools are needed to control for the uneven levels of sequencing. This simulation-based analysis shows that despite a longstanding controversy, rarefaction is the most robust approach to control for uneven sequencing effort. The controversy started because of confusion over the definition of rarefaction and violation of assumptions that are made by methods that have been borrowed from other fields. Microbial ecologists should use rarefaction.

    Studies of heat and mass exchange between leaves and their local environment
    are central to our understanding of plant‐atmosphere interactions. The
    transfer across aerodynamic leaf boundary layers is generally described by
    non‐dimensional expressions which reflect largely empirical adaptations of
    engineering models derived for flat plates. This paper reviews studies on
    leaves, and leaf models with varying degrees of abstraction, in free and
    forced convection. It discusses implecations of finding for leaf morphology
    as it affects – and is affected by – the local microclimate. Predictions of
    transfer from many leaves in plant communities are complicated by physical
    and physiological feedback mechanisms between leaves and their environment.
    Some common approaches, and the current challenge of integrating
    leaf‐atmosphere interactions into models of global relevance, are also
    briefly addressed.

    Summary
                Discovering a core microbiome is important for understanding the stable, consistent components across complex microbial assemblages. A core is typically defined as the suite of members shared among microbial consortia from similar habitats, and is represented by the overlapping areas of circles in Venn diagrams, in which each circle contains the membership of the sample or habitats being compared. Ecological insight into core microbiomes can be enriched by 'omics approaches that assess gene expression, thereby extending the concept of the core beyond taxonomically defined membership to community function and behaviour. Parameters defined by traditional ecology theory, such as composition, phylogeny, persistence and connectivity, will also create a more complex portrait of the core microbiome and advance understanding of the role of key microorganisms and functions within and across ecosystems.

    Abstract   We describe an accurate and efficient workflow for highly
    multiplexed paired-end Illumina sequencing of fungal full-length ITS
    amplicons. The impact of habitat and substratum conditions on
    leaf-inhabiting fungal communities was analysed. Fully vital and clearly
    senescent leaves of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) were sampled along an
    elevation gradient of about 1000m in the Bavarian Alps, Germany, in autumn
    2013. Surface-sterilised leaves were used for genomic DNA extraction,
    tagging-by-amplification and high-throughput sequencing. Significant
    correlation of community composition with elevation was observed. The
    mycobiome was little affected by the physiological state of the leaves,
    because only a partial shift of taxonomic composition was observed from
    vital towards clearly senescent leaves.

    Of the approximately 380 families of angiosperms, representatives of only 10
    are known to form symbiotic associations with nitrogen-fixing bacteria in
    root nodules. The morphologically based classification schemes proposed by
    taxonomists suggest that many of these 10 families of plants are only
    distantly related, engendering the hypothesis that the capacity to fix
    nitrogen evolved independently several, if not many, times. This has in turn
    influenced attitudes toward the likelihood of transferring genes responsible
    for symbiotic nitrogen fixation to crop species lacking this ability.
    Phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences for the chloroplast gene rbcL
    indicates, however, that representatives of all 10 families with
    nitrogen-fixing symbioses occur together, with several families lacking this
    association, in a single clade. This study therefore indicates that only one
    lineage of closely related taxa achieved the underlying genetic architecture
    necessary for symbiotic nitrogen fixation in root nodules.

    Epichloë fungal endophytes are broadly found in cool-season grasses. The
    symbiosis between these grasses and Epichloë may improve the abiotic and
    biotic resistance of the grass plant, but some Epichloë species produce
    alkaloids that are toxic for livestock. Therefore, it is important to
    understand the characteristics of the grass-Epichloë s symbiosis so that the
    beneficial aspects can be preserved and the toxic effects to livestock can
    be avoided. Since the 1990s, Chinese researchers have conducted a series of
    studies on grass-Epichloë symbiosis. In this review, we describe the current
    state of Epichloë endophyte research in Chinese native grasses. We found
    that more than 77 species of native grasses in China are associated with
    Epichloë endophytes. In addition, we review the effects of various Epichloë
    species on native grass responses to abiotic and biotic stress, phylogeny,
    and alkaloid production. We provide an overview of the study of Epichloë
    species on native grasses in China and directions for future research.

    ABSTRACT
              
                Organisms can adapt to environmental heterogeneity through two mechanisms: (1) expression of population genetic variation or (2) phenotypic plasticity. In this study we investigated whether patterns of variation in both trait means and phenotypic plasticity along elevational and latitudinal clines in a North American endemic plant,
                Mimulus laciniatus
                , were consistent with local adaptation. We grew inbred lines of
                M. laciniatus
                from across the species’ range in two common gardens varying in day length to measure mean and plastic trait expression in several traits previously shown to be involved in adaptation to
                M. laciniatus’s
                rocky outcrop microhabitat: flowering time, size-related traits, and leaf shape. We examined correlations between the mean phenotype and phenotypic plasticity, and tested for a relationship between trait variation and population elevation and latitude. We did not find a strong correlation between mean and plastic trait expression at the individual genotype level suggesting that they operate under independent genetic controls. We identified multiple traits that show patterns consistent with local adaptation to elevation: critical photoperiod, flowering time, flower size, mean leaf lobing, and leaf lobing plasticity. These trends occur along multiple geographically independent altitudinal clines indicating that selection is a more likely cause of this pattern than gene flow among nearby populations with similar trait values. We also found that population variation in mean leaf lobing is associated with latitude. Our results indicate that both having more highly lobed leaves and greater leaf shape plasticity may be adaptive at high elevation within
                M. laciniatus.
                Our data strongly suggest that traits known to be under divergent selection between
                M. laciniatus
                and close relative
                Mimulus guttatus
                are also under locally varying selection within
                M. laciniatus
                .

    Spatially and temporally varying selection can maintain genetic variation
    within and between populations, but it is less well known how these forces
    influence divergence between closely related species. We identify the
    interaction of temporal and spatial variation in selection and their role in
    either reinforcing or eroding divergence between two closely related
                  Mimulus
                  species. Using repeated reciprocal transplant experiments with advanced generation hybrids, we compare the strength of selection on quantitative traits involved in adaptation and reproductive isolation in
                  Mimulus guttatus
                  and
                  Mimulus laciniatus
                  between two years with dramatically different water availability
                  .
                  We found strong divergent habitat-mediated selection on traits in the direction of species differences during a drought in 2013, suggesting that spatially varying selection maintains species divergence. However, a relaxation in divergent selection on most traits in an unusually wet year (2019), including flowering time, which is involved in pre-zygotic isolation, suggests that temporal variation in selection may weaken species differences. Therefore, we find evidence that temporally and spatially varying selection may have opposing roles in mediating species boundaries. Given our changing climate, future growing seasons are expected to be more similar to the dry year, suggesting that in this system climate change may actually increase species divergence.

    Leaf traits of plants worldwide are classified according to the Leaf
    Economics Spectrum (LES), which links leaf functional traits to evolutionary
    life history strategies. As a continuum ranging from thicker, tough leaves
    that are low in nitrogen (N) to thinner, softer, leaves that are high in N,
    the LES brings together physical, chemical, and ecological traits. Fungal
    endophytes are common foliar symbionts that occur in healthy, living leaves,
    especially in tropical forests. Their community composition often differs
    among co-occurring host species in ways that cannot be explained by
    environmental conditions or host phylogenetic relationships. Here, we tested
    the over-arching hypothesis that LES traits act as habitat filters that
    shape communities of endophytes both in terms of composition, and in terms
    of selecting for endophytes with particular suites of functional traits. We
    used culture-based and culture-free surveys to characterize foliar
    endophytes in mature leaves of 30 phylogenetically diverse plant species
    with divergent LES traits in lowland Panama, and then measured functional
    traits of dominant endophyte taxa in vitro . Endophytes were less abundant
    and less diverse in thick, tough, leaves compared to thin, softer, leaves in
    the same forest, even in closely related plants. Endophyte communities
    differed according to leaf traits, including leaf punch strength and carbon
    and nitrogen content. The most common endophyte taxa in leaves at different
    ends of the LES differ in their cellulase, protease, chitinase, and
    antipathogen activity. Our results extend the LES framework for the first
    time to diverse and ecologically important endophytes, opening new
    hypotheses regarding the degree to which foliar symbionts respond to, and
    extend, the functional traits of leaves they inhabit.

    Abstract   Despite being major drivers of the dynamics and diversity of
    plant populations and communities, the spatial variability of phyllosphere
    fungal assemblages has been seldom explored. We used CE-SSCP and 454
    pyrosequencing to quantify the spatial variability of European beech
    phyllosphere fungal assemblages with a hierarchical sampling design
    including four different spatial scales (tree, branch, group of leaves and
    individual leaf). Fungal assemblages were highly diverse, with high
    proportions of generalist and cosmopolitan fungi. The major part of the
    variability was at the smallest spatial scale, between individual leaves.
    Within a single tree canopy, dissimilarity between fungal assemblages
    generally increased with distance between leaves. This pattern may be driven
    by within-canopy gradients of leaf traits and microclimate. At the stand
    scale, dissimilarity between fungal assemblages was correlated with the
    genetic distance rather than the geographic distance between trees,
    consistent with the findings of community genetics studies. Our results were
    constant over a small simulated sequencing depth, providing opportunities
    for the design of large-scale studies addressing the relationship between
    the genetic variation of trees and the variation of associated phyllosphere
    fungal assemblages.

    Phenotypic plasticity and genetic adaptation are predicted to mitigate some
    of the negative biotic consequences of climate change. Here, we evaluate
    evidence for plastic and evolutionary responses to climate variation in
    amphibians and reptiles via a literature review and meta-analysis. We
    included studies that either document phenotypic changes through time or
    space. Plasticity had a clear and ubiquitous role in promoting phenotypic
    changes in response to climate variation. For adaptive evolution, we found
    no direct evidence for evolution of amphibians or reptiles in response to
    climate change over time. However, we found many studies that documented
    adaptive responses to climate along spatial gradients. Plasticity provided a
    mixture of adaptive and maladaptive responses to climate change,
    highlighting that plasticity frequently, but not always, could ameliorate
    climate change. Based on our review, we advocate for more experiments that
    survey genetic changes through time in response to climate change. Overall,
    plastic and genetic variation in amphibians and reptiles could buffer some
    of the formidable threats from climate change, but large uncertainties
    remain owing to limited data.

    plant success, as they contain pathogens that devastate crop plants and taxa
    that enhance nutrient uptake, discourage herbivory, and antagonize
    pathogens. We measured leaf fungal diversity with amplicon sequencing across
    an entire growing season in a diversity panel of switchgrass (Panicum
    virgatum). We also sampled a replicated subset of genotypes across 3
    additional sites to compare the importance of time, space, ecology, and
    genetics. We found a strong successional pattern in the microbiome shaped
    both by host genetics and environmental factors. Further, we used
    genome-wide association (GWA) mapping and RNA sequencing to show that 3
    cysteine-rich receptor-like kinases (crRLKs) were linked to a genetic locus
    associated with microbiome structure. We confirmed GWAS results in an
    independent set of genotypes for both the internal transcribed spacer (ITS)
    and large subunit (LSU) ribosomal DNA markers. Fungal pathogens were central
    to microbial covariance networks, and genotypes susceptible to pathogens
    differed in their expression of the 3 crRLKs, suggesting that host immune
    genes are a principal means of controlling the entire leaf microbiome.

    Tremellomycetes rDNA sequences previously detected in wheat kernels by MiSeq
    were not reliably assigned to a genus or clade. From comparisons of
    ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) and subsequent
    phylogenetic analyses, the following three basidiomycetous yeasts were
    resolved and identified: Vishniacozymavictoriae, V. tephrensis, and an
    undescribed Vishniacozyma rDNA variant. The Vishniacozyma variant’s clade is
    evolutionarily close to, but phylogenetically distinct from, the V.
    carnescens clade. These three yeasts were discovered in wheat kernel samples
    from the Canadian prairies. Variations in relative Vishniacozyma species
    abundances coincided with altered wheat kernel weight, as well as host
    resistance to chemibiotrophic Tilletia (Common bunt—CB) and necrotrophic
    Fusarium (Fusarium head blight—FHB) pathogens. Wheat kernel weight was
    influenced by the coexistence of Vishniacozyma with endophytic plant
    growth-promoting and mycoparasitic biocontrol fungi that were acquired by
    plants. Kernels were coated with beneficial Penicillium endophyte and
    Sphaerodes mycoparasite, each of which had different influences on the wild
    yeast population. Its integral role in the kernel microbiome renders
    Vishniacozyma a measurable indicator of the microbiome–plant interaction.
    The ability of NGS technology to detect specific endophytic DNA variants and
    early changes in dynamics among symbionts within the kernel ecological niche
    enables the prediction of crop disease emergence, suggesting that advanced
    microbiological testing may be a potentially useful tool for both
    phytoprotection and more efficient wheat breeding programs.

    Abstract
                
                  Green islands (the re-greening of senescent leaf tissues) are particularly evident on leaves infected with fungal pathogens. To date, there is only a limited number of studies investigating foliar endophytic microorganisms in phytopathogen-infected leaves. Here, we analysed bacterial and fungal endophyte communities in leaves without green islands (control leaves; CL), within green island areas (GLA) and the surrounding yellow leaf areas (YLA) of leaves with green islands of
                  Acer campestre
                  and
                  A. platanoides
                  . GLA samples of
                  A. campestre
                  and
                  A. platanoides
                  were dominated by
                  Sawadaea polyfida
                  and
                  S. bicornis
                  , respectively, suggesting that these fungi might be responsible for the green islands. We detected a higher fungal richness and diversity in CL compared to GLA samples of
                  A. campestre
                  . Leaf status (CL, GLA, YLA) significantly altered the composition of fungal communities of
                  A. campestre
                  . This was related to differences in fungal community composition between YLA and GLA samples. Site was the main driver of bacterial communities, suggesting that bacterial and fungal endophytes are shaped by different factors. Overall, we observed
                  Acer
                  species-specific responses of endophyte communities towards the presence of green islands and/or leaf type, which might be attributed to several fungi and bacteria specifically associated with one
                  Acer
                  species.

    Bringing together leaf trait data spanning 2,548 species and 175 sites we
    describe, for the first time at global scale, a universal spectrum of leaf
    economics consisting of key chemical, structural and physiological
    properties. The spectrum runs from quick to slow return on investments of
    nutrients and dry mass in leaves, and operates largely independently of
    growth form, plant functional type or biome. Categories along the spectrum
    would, in general, describe leaf economic variation at the global scale
    better than plant functional types, because functional types overlap
    substantially in their leaf traits. Overall, modulation of leaf traits and
    trait relationships by climate is surprisingly modest, although some
    striking and significant patterns can be seen. Reliable quantification of
    the leaf economics spectrum and its interaction with climate will prove
    valuable for modelling nutrient fluxes and vegetation boundaries under
    changing land-use and climate.

    The plant genus Mimulus is rapidly emerging as a model system for studies of
    evolutionary and ecological functional genomics. Mimulus contains a wide
    array of phenotypic, ecological and genomic diversity. Numerous studies have
    proven the experimental tractability of Mimulus in laboratory and field
    studies. Genomic resources currently under development are making Mimulus an
    excellent system for determining the genetic and genomic basis of adaptation
    and speciation. Here, we introduce some of the phenotypic and genetic
    diversity in the genus Mimulus and highlight how direct genetic studies with
    Mimulus can address a wide spectrum of ecological and evolutionary
    questions. In addition, we present the genomic resources currently available
    for Mimulus and discuss future directions for research. The integration of
    ecology and genetics with bioinformatics and genome technology offers great
    promise for exploring the mechanistic basis of adaptive evolution and the
    genetics of speciation.

    Leaves, the primary plant organs that function in photosynthesis and
    respiration, have highly organized, flat structures that vary within and
    among species. In recent years, it has become evident that auxin plays
    central roles in leaf development, including leaf initiation, blade
    formation, and compound leaf patterning. In this review, we discuss how
    auxin maxima form to define leaf primordium formation. We summarize recent
    progress in understanding of how spatial auxin signaling promotes leaf blade
    formation. Finally, we discuss how spatial auxin transport and signaling
    regulate the patterning of compound leaves and leaf serration.

    Abstract
                
                  Specifying, assessing, and selecting among candidate statistical models is fundamental to ecological research. Commonly used approaches to model selection are based on predictive scores and include information criteria such as Akaike's information criterion, and cross validation. Based on data splitting, cross validation is particularly versatile because it can be used even when it is not possible to derive a likelihood (e.g., many forms of machine learning) or count parameters precisely (e.g., mixed‐effects models). However, much of the literature on cross validation is technical and spread across statistical journals, making it difficult for ecological analysts to assess and choose among the wide range of options. Here we provide a comprehensive, accessible review that explains important—but often overlooked—technical aspects of cross validation for model selection, such as: bias correction, estimation uncertainty, choice of scores, and selection rules to mitigate overfitting. We synthesize the relevant statistical advances to make recommendations for the choice of cross‐validation technique and we present two ecological case studies to illustrate their application. In most instances, we recommend using exact or approximate leave‐one‐out cross validation to minimize bias, or otherwise
                  k
                  ‐fold with bias correction if
                  k
                   < 10. To mitigate overfitting when using cross validation, we recommend calibrated selection via our recently introduced modified one‐standard‐error rule. We advocate for the use of predictive scores in model selection across a range of typical modeling goals, such as exploration, hypothesis testing, and prediction, provided that models are specified in accordance with the stated goal. We also emphasize, as others have done, that inference on parameter estimates is biased if preceded by model selection and instead requires a carefully specified single model or further technical adjustments.

    (Table presented.). Summary: Monkeyflowers (Mimulus) have long been
    recognized as a classic ecological and evolutionary model system. However,
    only recently has it been realized that this system also holds great promise
    for studying the developmental genetics and evo-devo of important plant
    traits that are not found in well-established model systems such as
    Arabidopsis. Here, I review recent progress in four different areas of plant
    research enabled by this new model, including transcriptional regulation of
    carotenoid biosynthesis, formation of periodic pigmentation patterns,
    developmental genetics of corolla tube formation and elaboration, and the
    molecular basis of floral trait divergence underlying pollinator shift.
    These examples suggest that Mimulus offers ample opportunities to make
    exciting discoveries in plant development and evolution.
